Whew, what a week.  Recovering from Florida has been rough, but I've done it somehow.  You can see pics <a href="http://www.6thdensity.net/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=4">here</a> - just don't bitch about them.  I'm a crappy photographer and I know it.

Well, I've been playing a lot of Scrabble lately because my friends Bill and Sara got us addicted to it.  Tasha bought the game for me (or her?) for my birthday.  But playing with Tasha is so hard... she's such a whiner!  I think things will be better now that Tasha finally beat me last night.

Anyway, big weekend of hanging out coming up, and the superbowl, yay.
