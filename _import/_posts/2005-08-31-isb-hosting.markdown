<p>Greetings, fellow product consumers.  Just wanted to give a shout out to <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt</a> and plug his (sort of) new web hosting company.  Check out the new ad on the right sidebar.  If you're looking for webspace, you want to go with <a href="http://isbhosting.com">ISB</a> because Matt gets his kicks by providing quick and efficient technical support and customer service.  He wants to run a small, tight ship and deliver value.  I highly recommend ISB Hosting and have one three times a day!</p><p><i>The poster is not affiliated with ISB Hosting in any way, shape, or form, other than having been threatened to either plug his friend's site or have his server space turned over to file hosting for clown juggling mpegs.  In other words, no money was made off this ad.  And I'm not happy about that.</i></p>
