Well, I had a great time at the Phish show at Hampton Colliseum.  It was about what I expected, performance wise.  It was a decent show, with good moments.  I'm still thinking about it, so that's a good sign.  Hampton is a nice place to see a show, with the seating and plenty of room on the floor.  It was nice.

We were a little worried because the friend of the friend who had our tickets couldn't be reached until we were actually parked in line to get into the parking lot.  Finally, after realizing we had the wrong number, our friend gave us the right one and we got the tickets.  We hung out in a grassy part of the parking lot and let our friends gather at our canopy.  Had a nice little chill out, especially since the State Police decided to camp out the entire pre-show right next to us.  I forgot how sketch Phish shows are, and Hampton used to be pretty quiet.

So I took Monday and Tuesday off, and now I'm back.  Soooo much shit on my plate, it's not funny.
