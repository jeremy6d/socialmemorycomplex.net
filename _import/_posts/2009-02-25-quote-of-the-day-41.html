<p>I haven't forgotten about <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/2008/08/29/life-events/#comments">those who have asked</a> for a better explanation of the <a href="http://lawofone.info">Law of One</a> which I mention every once in a while.  An introduction is still forthcoming, I promise.  But until then, perhaps <a href="http://lawofone.info/results.php?session_id=10&ss=1#14">this excerpt</a> from the source material may help the reader grasp the spirit of this work.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Questioner:</strong> For the general development of the reader of this book, could you state some of the practices or exercises to perform to produce an acceleration toward the Law of One?</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> ....Exercise One. This is the most nearly centered and useable within your illusion complex. The moment contains love. That is the lesson/goal of this illusion or density. The exercise is to consciously see that love in awareness and understanding distortions. The first attempt is the cornerstone. Upon this choosing rests the remainder of the life-experience of an entity. The second seeking of love within the moment begins the addition. The third seeking empowers the second, the fourth powering or doubling the third. As with the previous type of empowerment, there will be some loss of power due to flaws within the seeking in the distortion of insincerity. However, the conscious statement of self to self of the desire to seek love is so central an act of will that, as before, the loss of power due to this friction is inconsequential.</p><p>Exercise Two. The universe is one being. When a mind/body/spirit complex views another mind/body/spirit complex, see the Creator. This is an helpful exercise.</p><p>Exercise Three. Gaze within a mirror. See the Creator.</p><p>Exercise Four. Gaze at the creation which lies about the mind/body/spirit complex of each entity. See the Creator.</p><p>The foundation or prerequisite of these exercises is a predilection towards what may be called meditation, contemplation, or prayer. With this attitude, these exercises can be processed. Without it, the data will not sink down into the roots of the tree of mind, thus enabling and ennobling the body and touching the spirit.</p></blockquote><p>Feel free to ask questions which will help me provide a better explanation in the future of what this crazy stuff I'm into is all about.</p>
