<p><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/ruby1.png' alt='ruby.png' style='float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;' />Praise be to jeebus - a development release of Ruby 1.9.0 was announced on <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/12/25/ruby-1-9-0-released/">ruby-lang.org</a> Christmas Day (nice timing for the western world).  I guess it's too early to install on my new slice, and probably better to wait for the package anyway.  Nevertheless, <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=821">at RubyConf this year</a> we got a sneak peak at the priorities and decisions that have been guiding the implementation of 1.9, which above all should be <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/12/03/the-great-ruby-shootout/">much faster than 1.8</a> (and <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/28/holy-shmoly-ruby-19-smokes-python-away/">more competitive with other languages</a>).  More detailed changes <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki/mechanically-verified-ruby19-changelog">here</a>.</p><p>Also, in case you didn't hear, <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2007/12/7/rails-2-0-it-s-done">Rails 2.0 was released last month</a>.  'Tis hot.  And I finally figured out that scaffolding has NOT been gutted; I had lamented the fact that the scaffolded views no longer generated HTML input fields based on the database table fields.  But now it's much more consistent: you name the fields at generation time and it creates the views and the migration for you.  Kids, it pays to read the docs.</p>
