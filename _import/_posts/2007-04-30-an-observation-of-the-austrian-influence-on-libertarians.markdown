<p>I was an LP member for over five years, and was on the central committee for the state party for the last year. In that whole time, I never heard once about the Mises, Rothbard, or the Austrian school of economics.</p><p>Looking back on that, I'm flabbergasted.  How could such important work, so vital to the foundation of libertarian thought, have not reached me?  Frankly, I don't think I should have to have been overly curious to stumble upon some sort of treatment of Austrians, but there you have it.</p><p>Does this surprise anybody else?  I find it odd.</p>
