Whoa, boy.  I have been just way to lazy to update my blog.  So let me apologize to all my fans.  

Yeah, uh, sorry Clyde!  :-)

Anyway, this weekend was wierd.  I spent Saturday napping and drinking beer and defending my <a href="http://www.brotherspast.com">favorite band's</a> honor.  Sunday I spent chatting with our friends in Richmond who are having a baby.  Then we picked up Tasha's sister from the airport.  On the way home I got a flat tire, so I pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant we were headed to.  Tasha and her sister ate while I tried to fix the flat with that foam stuff.  That shit does NOT work.  It tells you to spray the foam in the tire, and then to drive around for 4 miles if the rim's off the ground.  Well, it was off the ground, so I drove around for 4 mi, only to find that after the drive the rim WAS on the ground :-( so fuck that, I called AAA to come out and change my tire (I was wierd about changing it because the parking lot was inclined) but ended up changing it while waiting for the tow truck.  The guy was pretty cool about being called out for nothing - I used to work for GEICO dispatching tow trucks to customers, and they can be pretty fucking petty.  Anyway, I was able to get the tire fixed the next day so it all turned out ok.

Trying to decide whether I should head down to Raleigh tonight for the BP show.  We'll see.
