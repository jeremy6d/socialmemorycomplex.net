<p><blockquote>But a man with a gun (the power to punish) is told only what his target thinks will not cause him to pull the trigger. The elite, with their burden of omniscience, face the underlings, with their burden of nescience, and receive only the feedback consistent with their own preconceived notions. The burden of omniscience becomes, in short, another and more complex burden of nescience. Nobody really knows anything anymore, or if they do, they are careful to hide the fact.</blockquote></p><p style="text-align: right; margin-right: 2em;">- <a href="http://www.blackcrayon.com/people/RAW/">Robert Anton Wilson</a></p>
