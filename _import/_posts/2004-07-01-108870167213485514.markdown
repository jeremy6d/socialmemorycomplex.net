A <a href="http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/24159.htm">Guys Gone Wild</a> video?  WTF?  Who wants to see that?  I guess somebody who maybe didn't go to college...?  But that's kind of my argument against the Girls Gone Wild videos, too.  I mean, don't buy the tapes - just go to your local campus party.  In other words, have a life.

At least this will shut up feminists (ehh, unlikely).
