Ha - if you're wondering where I've been, I've got two words for you:

FLORIDA, BABY!!!

That's right, me and my crew rolled down to Tampa to see <a href="http://brotherspast.com">Brothers Past</a> in Ybor City, then drove to Ft. Lauderdale to see em again before flying back.  Getting back sucked because of flight delays due to the winter storms in the DC area, but it was still pretty cool.  Just trying to recover from it all.  I'll get pictures up soon.

And if you haven't tasted the Pink Panty Pull Down, you haven't lived life.

So, what's been going on while I've been gone?  Did Iraq vote?  Is it still even there?
