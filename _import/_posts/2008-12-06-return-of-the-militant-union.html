<p>Looks like some workers have discovered they have more options than simply striking:</p><blockquote><p>Workers laid off from their jobs at a factory have occupied the building and are demanding assurances they'll get severance and vacation pay that they say they are owed.</p>...<p>During the peaceful takeover, workers have been shoveling snow and cleaning the building, Fried said.</p><p>"We're doing something we haven't since the 1930s, so we're trying to make it work," Fried said.</p></blockquote><p>The above quote is from <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ildwrFjwHYjvJPX2edZgBnNb8EEQD94TCJ5G4">the A.P. article</a>, but <a href="http://socialistworker.org/2008/12/06/republic-window-occupation">the Socialist Worker one</a> is more detailed.  While this is an encouraging development in the labor struggle, I wonder if such radical tactics will catch on as the economy goes to shit.  This is a step in the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/south-america/2007/08/argentina-workers-movement">right direction,</a> though: labor homesteading the means of production that only exist in capitalist hands because of a statist title system, instead of begging the government for mercy.</p>
