<p>Well, it's not my best commentary, but <a href="http://westofshockoe.blogspot.com/2007/06/california-justice-system-makes-me-sick.html#8839196136913130798">fuck</a>... this is <em>Paris Hiton</em> that we're actually talking about here.  Not the absurdity of the police state or the justice of DUI / government licensing.  With all the problems going on day in and day out, we focus our time and attention not on the abuses by the State, but on locking up some airheaded twit?  For the "crime" of government disapproval?</p><p>C'mon, Richmond - you can do better than this.</p>
