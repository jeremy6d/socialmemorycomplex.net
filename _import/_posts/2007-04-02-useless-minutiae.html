	<li>Radley Balko totally got me for April Fools.  I had <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/archives/027647.php">his post</a> suggesting the institution of a fourth, administrative branch of the Federal government all ready for an excoriating attack with more than one mention of "vulgar libertarianism".  Me so STUPID!!!!</li>
	<li>Tasha and I saw the Decemberists last night in Norfolk.  I like their music, and they make good records, but I found their performance somewhat uncompelling.  Plus: I felt old.  I had a lot more fun when I caught them at the Austin City Limits fest.  Hopefully the Flaming Lips concert in a few weeks will kick more ass - I mean, hell, Norfolk is almost two hours away, and that's when the traffic's O.K.</li>
	<li>I'm probably going to attend the Patrick Henry Supper Club tomorrow to touch base with the mainstream libertarians in the Richmond area and announce <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org">this left libertarian group</a> I'm starting.  That means I should probably figure out where I want to hold the first meeting, right.  I'm sorely tempted to just have everybody meet at Commercial Tap House, though I don't know if I can reserve tables or what not.</li>
	<li>It gives me great pleasure to announce that I'll be hosting the <a href="http://jsnotes.blogspot.com/2007/03/call-for-submissions-to-rva-blog.html">RVA Blog Carnival</a> this week, so if you're a Richmond blogger who has something - anything - you think deserves a mention, let me know.</li>
