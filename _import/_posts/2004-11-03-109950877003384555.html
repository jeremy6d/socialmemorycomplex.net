One thing I know for certain: <u>we will get what we deserve</u>.  We always do.  We will become that which we fear.

I'm not as angry as <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2004/11/five-stages-of-grieving-for-george.html">this guy</a> but I certainly understand the sense of impending doom and dread.  What we have to do now is two things:

1. Convince the Democrats that this is not the 90s, and they do not have Clinton.  They no longer can claim the title of the populists, and they need to drastically reshape their politics.  If they want to oppose the Republicans, they're gonna have to find a way not only to provide a discernable alternative, but also to do it without <a href="http://6thdensity.net/blog/2004/11/heres-post-i-did-on-message-board-i.html">looking down on traditional American values.  The snobbiness must end.</a>  Because we all know that the Republicans are the real elitists; they just play the PR game nastier and better.

2. Keep riding the Bush Administration's ass.  <a href="http://6thdensity.net/blog/2004/11/ha-election-is-tomorrow.html">They may be unwilling to see reality</a>, but I'm not willing to write off the rest of the electorate.  Americans thirst for revenge, but they also recognize the validity of things like facts, figures, and body counts.  Our job should be to continue to present the case against the policies of this administration.

And get ready for four more years of nastiness.  Make peace with yourself, for it will be hard to find it outside.  And thank God we won't have to listen to Rush Limbaugh bitch for the next 20 years while all hopped up painkillers.
