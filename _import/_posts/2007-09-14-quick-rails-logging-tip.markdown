<p>It's not difficult to alter how Rails logs requests.  Just look at <code>ActionController::Base#log_processing</code> (see code <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/actionpack/lib/action_controller/base.rb#L1086">here</a>), and you can see that's it's basically just printing <code>request.inspect</code>.  So if you override that method in your <code>ApplicationController</code>, you can change how requests are logged.  This was important for me, because I'm using <code>gsub</code> to wipe credit card numbers from the log.  Works like a charm!</p>
