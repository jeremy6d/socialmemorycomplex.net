<p>What a wonderful day everybody had yesterday at the marriage of Jim and Megan.  Yesterday at the wedding, Megan's maid of honor spoke on how the sincerity and warmness of Jim and Megan's relationship so infectiously spreads among their friends and even catalyzes new friendships in the wake of their love.  I really couldn't have said it better (indeed, her version of the idea was much less tortured sounding!).  I'm so proud of and happy for them and the awesome, beautiful life they're going to have together!</p>
