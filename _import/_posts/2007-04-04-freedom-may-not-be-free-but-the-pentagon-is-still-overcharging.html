Why is one so important to the other that it is trotted out as an excuse for every conceivable action by the armed forces?  I don't get it... there appear to be many countries around the world where their military doesn't play that big of a role in their freedoms.  What's the connection?  I don't get it.

I have to admit: I kind of resent the notion that, just because I don't want to take orders from some fascist fuck, I wouldn't defend this country from an authentic threat.  It also strikes me as a bit wrongheaded to put the defense of your freedom is somebody else's hands (which explains the Right's police state cheerleading). Why should the soldiers do all the work on the taxpayer dime - especially if you're so pro-America?  Why not take it upon yourself to defend your community, family, and self - cut out the middleman?  (For conservative military gung-ho types: <em>what, are you skeered?!?!</em>)

I think we're much safer as a result of popular firearms ownership than as a result of the military industrial complex.  A rifle behind each blade of grass, just like Admiral Yamamoto <a href="http://www.famousquotes.com/show.php?_id=1053677">said</a>, is the best guarantee of our freedom from foreign or domestic governments.  I think the latter is a bigger threat than the former at this particular juncture, but the point still stands even if you're more afraid of terrorists.

Speaking of which, Mike at the supper club yesterday clued me into the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/agcr308">American Gun Culture Report</a>, which is a sort of lefty gun magazine.  What a great looking zine - I've long suspected that the Right's fixation with guns was some sort of wierd reverse psychology trick to make sure the Left was always unarmed. Join the anti-NRA!
