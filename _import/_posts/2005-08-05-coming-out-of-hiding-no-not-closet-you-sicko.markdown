<p>Hey!  How are you doing?  Been a while, huh?</p><p>Yeah, I know, I know, shut up.  Let me explain.  Pretty much just now I have gotten out of a hugely stressful time of moving from Tappahannock to Richmond.  So now that I'm all settled in and hummin' along, I intend to start blogging again.</p><p>On a slightly different note, <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.typepad.com/right_thinking_girl/2005/08/what_i_know_abo.html">look what RightThinkingGirl said about me!</a>  Now there's a lady who knows how to keep a blog current.  Kudos to your, CJ.
