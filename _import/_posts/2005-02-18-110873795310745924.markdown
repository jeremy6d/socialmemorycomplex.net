Poor, confused Richard Perle - reality just keeps catching him off guard!  But that won't keep him from dreaming.<blockquote>Perle, a veteran of the Reagan administration and a former Pentagon adviser, was forced by one of the questioners to recast a comment he made on Sept. 22, 2003, in which he predicted that within one year, there would be "a grand square in Baghdad named for President Bush."

"I'd be a fool not to recognize that it did not happen on the schedule I had in mind," Perle said, adding that he did not deny that the administration had made mistakes in Iraq.

But, Perle added, "I will be surprised, yet again, if we do not see a square in Baghdad named after this president." He did not specify a time.</blockquote>No wonder <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050218/D88AU37G0.html">somebody threw a shoe at him</a>.
