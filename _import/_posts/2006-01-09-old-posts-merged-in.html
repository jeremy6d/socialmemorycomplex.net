<ul>
	<li>I finally had occasion to import all my old Blogger posts into this WordPress incarnation of the blog.  Check the archives for the old shit.</li>
	<li>I'll continue to keep the blogger site accessible, just for giggles.  I also fixed all the broken links, so it should look decent.  I'm actually working on a WordPress template that takes cues from my old Blogger template, but doesn't look so dumb.</li>
	<li><em>Bring It Back</em> is the name of the new album coming out soon from one of my favorite bands, <a href="http://www.matesofstate.com">Mates of State</a>.</li>
</ul>
