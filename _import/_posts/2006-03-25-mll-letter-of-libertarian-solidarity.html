<p>At <a href="http://bradspangler.com">Brad Spangler's blog</a> there's a great <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/370">letter of libertarian solidarity with French protests against CPE</a> which I've signed as a supporter of the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/lobby/9167/">Movement of the Libertarian Left</a>.  I encourage you to lend your support in their own revolutionary struggle against further consolidation of state market power.</p>
