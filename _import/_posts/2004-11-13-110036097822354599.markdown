In keeping with my theme of mutating the Democrats into the Libertarian Party, check out <a href="http://libertariansforamerica.blogs.com/index/">this blog</a> that talks all about it.  Also, apparently there is a <a href="http://www.democraticfreedomcaucus.org/">Democratic Freedom Caucus</a> that pushes the Democrats towards libertarian policies (just like the <a href="http://republicanlibertycaucus.org/">Republican Liberty Caucus</a>).  I'll be doing some reading at these sites.  Join me, won't you?
