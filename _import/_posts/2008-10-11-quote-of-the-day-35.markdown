<p>There's been a lot of quotable lines since I last blogged (sorry so seldom), but here's a great one that bears reminding as we go through this national doubting of our fundamentals:</p><blockquote><p>I think it was Michael Kinsley, 25 years ago, who said of course Republicans in power are going to lead to deficits. A budget in balance or surplus represents government collecting taxes from rich people to fund its functions. A vudget in deficit represents government paying rich people interest (on bonds) to fund its functions.</p></blockquote>
