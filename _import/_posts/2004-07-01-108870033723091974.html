Man, I just recently joined <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/intjopen/">a group for INTJs</a>, and we're some argumentative assholes, let me tell ya.  But, we tend to concede when we don't know something, at least something not absolutely central to our belief system.  And I like that.  The most interesting conversation now is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/intjopen/message/24379">my discussion of morality with an honest to God Calvinist</a>!  What a cool wacko!  :-)

We may be assholes, but at least we're not you.  HA!
