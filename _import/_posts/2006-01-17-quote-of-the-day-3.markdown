From <a href="http://jimbovard.com/blog/2006/01/17/credo-from-attention-deficit-democracy/">Jim Bovard</a>:
<blockquote><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"><strong>Credo for the New American Patriotism</strong> </font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">I believe:</font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That politicians are more honest than they seem;</font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That government is more competent than it appears;</font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS"> </font><font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS" />

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That government is benevolent, regardless of how much it wastes or how many people it harms;</font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That citizens must trust the government, regardless of how often it lies;</font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That democracy is a panacea, regardless of how often it fails;</font>

<font size="2" face="Trebuchet MS">That freedom is whatever the president says it is, pending revision.</font></blockquote>
Awesome.  Can't wait to read his forthcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1403971080/qid=1137537192/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-1336955-3653663?n=507846&s=books&v=glance">Attention Deficit Democracy</a>.
