<p>This man who claims the throne of America <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/09/02/D8CC53POL.html">continues to astound me</a>:<blockquote> <p>"There's a lot of aid surging toward those who've been affected. Millions of gallons of water. Millions of tons of food. We're making progress about pulling people out of the Superdome," the president said.</p><p>For the first time, however, he stopped defending his administration's response and criticized it. "A lot of people are working hard to help those who've been affected. The results are not acceptable," he said. "I'm heading down there right now."</p></blockquote>So, <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=130#comment-427">Matt</a>, are you gonna jump on Bush the same way you jump on me about being all talk and no action?</p>
