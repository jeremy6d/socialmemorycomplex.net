<p>Via <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/2007/04/21/clanking-glory/">Roderick Long</a> comes this quote of former SDS president Charles Oglesby from his 1967 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_b/002-2432457-8799248?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=oglesby+containment+change&Go.x=9&Go.y=11/praxeologynet-20">Containment and Change</a> (emphasis mine):<blockquote><p>The one and only basic question which Americans now have to ask themselves is whether or not they want to be politically free. … The superstate … may give of its bounty to those who will ritually humble themselves before it. But the state cannot give political freedom. <em>It is neither in the nature of the state that it can give political freedom nor in the nature of political freedom that it can be given</em>. Political freedom is not a license to be purchased or petitioned from a higher power. …</p></blockquote>Excellently said.  Libertarians would do well to remember this.</p>
