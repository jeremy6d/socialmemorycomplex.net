<a href="http://www.theunionleader.com/articles_showfast.html?article=42692">From the paranoid delusions department</a>:<blockquote>Republican-haters plan on dressing up as RNC volunteers, and giving false directions to little blue hair ladies from Kansas, sending them into the sectors of New York City that are unfit for human habitation. 

They plan on throwing pies and Lord knows what else at Republican visitors to the city. Prostitutes with AIDS plan to seduce Republican visitors, and discourage the use of condoms, according to liberal journalist Ted Rall.</blockquote>This cannot be for real.  Just when you think politics in this country can't get more base, somebody up and outdoes Ann Coulter.  I'm at a loss - <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wilforbis/weblogs/blogger.htm">Wil</a>, you're gonna have to supply this punchline.
