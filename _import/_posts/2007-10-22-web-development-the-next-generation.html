<p>Over at the Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts Group (<a href="http://cvreg.org">cvreg.org</a>) blog I recently contributed <a href="http://cvreg.org/">an article</a> reflecting on my talk to a local high school web design class.  Since the overwhelming topic was money and jobs, not the art of programming and design, I had a chance to impart some of my observations of the industry to them.  Here's an excerpt:<blockquote><p>Get used to learning constantly. Things move way too fast in this industry for you to learn one language and have that make your career. It's better to challenge yourself by engaging in a wide variety of technologies to hone your general programming, debugging, testing, and other skills. Try out new languages, read blogs, go to conferences, and do your own experimental projects to challenge yourself. Be the guy that can solve any problem with the right tool, rather than "the Java guy" or even "the Ruby guy".</p></blockquote></p>
