In an IM conversation with my <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">co-worker</a> (who's 5 feet away from me, I know, I know) I said:
<ul>
	<li>"If we have to use force, it is because we are America. We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further into the future." -- Madeleine Albright</li>
	<li>roflmao</li>
	<li>(well, not really)</li>
	<li>on the internet, nobody knows you're not ROFLMAO</li>
</ul>
