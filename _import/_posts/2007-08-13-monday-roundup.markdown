Thanks to <a href="http://www.simplisticcomplexity.com/">Jon</a>, <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">Jim</a>, and <a href="http://www.sneaq.net">Patrick</a> for the company on the near-3 hour drive.  There were some wonderful presentations, including one on MERB, tuning Ruby using C, and some reflections on the state of the Ruby community.  These coming weeks I'm going to need to knuckle down and blast out code, but being able to see the exciting stuff people are thinking about and doing in the community is awesome.  The conference was superbly organized and at $100 a killer value.  Looking forward to next year!</p><p>BTW, check out <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/maddox/1087120073/">this hilarious poster</a> we saw at the gas station we stopped at on the way to and from the conference.  Mecklenburg County reprazent!</p>
