Whoa, apparently Ike met with aliens, says the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A53203-2004Feb18?language=printer">Post</a>:<blockquote>These aliens -- nicknamed "Nordics" in UFO circles because they resemble Scandinavian humans -- traveled to Edwards from another solar system in a flying saucer and, Salla says, they spoke to Eisenhower.

"There was telepathic communication," says Salla, 45, as he sits in his suburban Falls Church living room. "It's as though you're hearing a person but they're not speaking."

The "Nordics" offered to share their superior technology and their spiritual wisdom with Ike if he would agree to eliminate America's nuclear weapons. 

"They were afraid we might blow up some of our nuclear technology," Salla says, "and apparently that does something to time and space and it impacts on extraterrestrial races on other planets."

Ike declined the ETs' offer, Salla says, because he did not want to give up the nukes.</blockquote>I'm not sure what's more surprising - that the Washington Post actually wrote a story about this (why now?) or that Ike turned down getting rid of nukes to get ETs in his posse, not to mention spiritual information.

What a dumbass.  Bet JFK would have taken them up on it.  Bet he would have hit them up for a dime bag of space coke, too, and a space presidential model taboot.  But I digress... towards entropy...
