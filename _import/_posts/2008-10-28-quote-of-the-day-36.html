<blockquote><p>Every manager in a current corporation knows that they have been doing this (fudging their business's value) on a systematic basis since the 80’s and that the value is purely based on a consensus, which in fact created a pyramid scheme. This is in my view the reason of the crisis of confidence, since they know deep down that their own value is bogus, how can they trust anyone else’s?</p></blockquote><p align=right>- <a href="http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-value-shock/2008/10/11">Michael Bauwens</a></p>
