<p>James Leroy Wilson <a href="http://www.downsizedc.org/blog/2007/apr/25/what_year_is_this">captures</a> the circular logic of the anti-cut-and-run crowd:<blockquote>It's the terrible logic of the war: "We must occupy Iraq until we defeat those who are fighting our occupation. Once those who want us to leave are defeated, we will leave." But since us leaving is exactly what the enemy wants, they will declare victory whenever we leave - even if its ten years from now. Our presence is the very cause of the instability that prevents us from "winning" the war, but if we ever leave, we "lose" the war.</blockquote></p>
