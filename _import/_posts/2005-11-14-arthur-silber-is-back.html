<p>My favorite serious blog of all time is Arthur Silber's <a href="http://coldfury.com/reason/files/Manifesto.htm">The Light of Reason</a>.  It was like reading the blog of somebody with the passion of an objectivist but the common sense of an average joe and the heart of a... well, a big heart.  OK, that's a little bit of exaggeration.  But his posts influenced my move from stoic, rigid right libertarianism to a more (forgive the term) holistic embrace of free association, markets, and thought.  He even got me to vote for Kerry.</p><p>Well, he ran into some rough times and his blog ended up being a pain in the ass for him.  Now he has a new blog called <a href="http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com">Once Upon a Time</a>.  Check out this very interesting <a href="http://powerofnarrative.blogspot.com/2005/11/latest-hit-job-by-malkin-and-her.html">post</a> of his and see what I mean.</p>
