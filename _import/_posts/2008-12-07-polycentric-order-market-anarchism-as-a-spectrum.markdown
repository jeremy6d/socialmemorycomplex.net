title: "Polycentric Order: Market Anarchism as a Spectrum"
excerpt: "&quot;I consider market anarchism to be neither utopian or dystopian. Rather, I consider it to be a framework or context in which experimentation can take place in the process of trying to appease human needs and wants, and the enabling of peaceful co-existance. Uniformity in terms of personal preferances and cultural attitudes is not necessary for market anarchism to function, and such things become greatly reduced in their significance in the grand scheme of things as the emphasis is placed more on the generation and pursuit of economic incentives.&quot;"
