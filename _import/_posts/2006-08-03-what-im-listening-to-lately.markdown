<p>I've been meaning to do more music blogging, but since I have little to say about music, I'm just going to list what I'm listening to:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>Belle and Sebastian</u>: I'm obsessed with <em>The Life Pursuit</em>, and <em>If You're Feeling Sinister</em> is great as well.  I don't care if that makes me gay.  The former album is absolutely stunningly done from a production, songwriting, and orchestration standpoint.</li>
<li><u>Gravenhurst</u>: a mix of touching folk and electric trash... their <em>Fires in Distant Buildings </em>is amazing, and <em>Flashlights</em> is a great album as well (though not as sprawling sound-wise).</li>
<li><u>Band of Horses</u>: <em>Everything All the Time </em>is a great album chock full of modern rock anthems.  This album will lodge itself squarely in your noggin.</li>
<li><u>Keane</u>: Again, I'm a little embarrassed by this, but <em>Hopes and Fears</em> is far too catchy and well produced.  It might be too pop, but oh well - I guess that makes me a bubble gummer.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are you listening to?  I'm constantly on the lookout for new tunes, so lemme know!
