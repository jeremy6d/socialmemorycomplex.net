Well, I won't say who I voted for, but I'm glad it's over.  We've now moved in our petty workplace conversations from the question of "for whom to vote" to "who will win".  It's not quite as empirical a question as it used to be, but at least it doesn't involve me in quite as many polarizing conversations.  Like the one I just had with my Dad.  That lasted two hours.  Yeah, those days are done.
