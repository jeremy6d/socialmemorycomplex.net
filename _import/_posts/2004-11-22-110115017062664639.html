Remind me again: why do people watch this guy's show?  Oh, yeah because <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041122/ap_en_bu/trump_casino_bankruptcy_19">he's such a successful businessman</a>:<blockquote>Trump denied the bankruptcy was a setback. 


"I don't think it's a failure, <b>it's a <u>success</u></b>," he said in the interview. "In this case, it was just something that worked better than other alternatives. It's really just a technical thing, but it came together." 


"We have one of the most powerful gaming companies the day it comes out (of bankruptcy). There's no way we could have done that without the 'B' word," he said. 


He said "the future looks very good." </blockquote>See, when defaulting on your loans is considered success in corporate America, don't talk to me about free markets and capitalism.  This bullshit makes me sick - I'm entirely convinced that corporate America is part of the problem in reestablishing a sustainable, free economy in this country.  Bankruptcy is a success?  I guess being high on crack is a success, too.
