If any of my readers want to see how not to do a blog, please visit <a href="http://libertariangirl.blogspot.com">Libertarian Girl</a>.  I'd deliver the cutdowns myself, but why should I when <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/blog.html">Mr. X</a> <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/2005/01/libertarian-girl-vapid-and-now.html">has done it so well</a>?

I feel like a tool for defending her.  Yes, we need more females in the movement.  And I still think we need more non-intellectual brainiacs in the movement.  But what we don't need is pseudo-intellectual, hyperrandian morons.

I mean, a pink background?  C'mon!

UPDATE: Libertarian Girl has added a disclaimer to her blog:<blockquote>Warning: the opinions expressed in this blog do not represent the official platform of the Libertarian Party. Read at your own risk</blockquote>To be honest, although Mr. X and <a href="http://choosewisely.blogspot.com/">R</a> question her libertarian credentials, I don't.  She's quite clearly a libertarian.  What you risk is being utterly bored by reading her blog.  She is neither insightful nor entertaining.  There's some <a href="http://libertariangirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/about-post-about-last-night.html">controversy</a> concerning her sexual exploits and whether it is inappropriate to include that in blogging.  I think it's fair game; it's just not necessarily interesting.  She's claiming she's the victim of sexist double standards, but I don't really see a lot of male bloggers talking about all the booty they get (I expect there's a DAMN good reason for this: male bloggers are nerds).  Now, I've seen some female bloggers tell some damn good stories in the hot'n'wet gossip vein, but operative verb here: <b>tell</b>.  Libertarian Girl can't write herself out of of a pink Victoria's Secret bag, and that's why her blog sucks.  I'll probably check in every once in a while to see if she's improved, and if so I'll gladly eat crow, but I believe she just wants a soapbox and attention.  Like R says, you can't help but look at the train-wreck aspect of the blog.
