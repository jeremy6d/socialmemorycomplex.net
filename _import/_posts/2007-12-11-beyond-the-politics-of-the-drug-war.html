<p>Radley Balko has just <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2007/12/10/from-mississippi/">posted</a> what I think is the most moving essay yet on the <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/category/cory-maye/">Cory Maye</a> case and the drug war in general (if you think it's worth sharing, <a href="http://digg.com/political_opinion/From_Mississippi">digg it</a>).  Getting beyond the legalities, moral appeals, and outrage, Balko simply recounts how the drug war cost a good cop his life and a great father his family and freedom.  When you feel like the cards are stacked against any chance of decency in this world, read this post and dig deep down for the strength, not simply to vote for the right politicians and see the right policies enacted, but to make your neighborhood a better, safer, more humane place.</p>
