Y'know, a lot of bloggers are writing indignant and/or defensive posts about <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Inauguration/story?id=406639&amp;page=1">this story</a>.

But not me.  It pretty much speaks for itself.

And am I the only person on planet Earth that thinks <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4169557.stm">Thatcher's son being exposed in a coup plot</a> is more than a little freaky?

And yes, the time you're reading at the top of the post is correct.  I am posting at 8:26 AM.  I've been up for three hours and I feel great.
