title: "Keith Preston: Why I Am an Anarcho-Pluralist"
excerpt: "&quot;Political victory in the United States is achieved through the assembling of coalitions of narrow interest groups who often have little in common with one another (gun toting rednecks and country club Republicans, homosexuals and traditional working class union Democrats). Imagine if a third force emerged in U.S. politics whose only unifying principle was a common desire to remove one\x92s self and one\x92s community from the system. The only thing anyone has to give up is the desire to tell other communities what to do.&quot;"
