<p>Name one thing we can do <em>right now</em> to advance the concept of the voluntary society; anything that's concrete.  I'm just curious what others think about this - I brought it up on a discussion list and only got one good response.  What do you think?  We have to start somewhere before we can actually <em>start</em>.</p><p>If you lurk, please weigh in with your two cents - just this once!  We need your input.</p>
