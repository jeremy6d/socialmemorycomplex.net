<p>I'm tweaking my spam software a bit to try and make my life easier.  If you're having problems commenting, email me at: my_first_name at 6thdensity period net.</p><p>This is part of a bit of an overhaul that's in the works.  I still love the custom theme I created for this blog.  However, there's some functional and organizational loose ends that I haven't tied up.  For example:<ul><li>the poor search results display page</li><li>the blogroll and link list are just totally missing (looks like the API got updated on me)</li><li>the comment form never looks right</li><li>the underlying code could be a little more consistent and look a little less hacked</li><li>layout conventions should be in the stylesheet for consistency's sake (instead of me putting CSS and HTML directly into my posts everytime I want to float an image)</li></ul>Generally speaking, there's just some clean up that I haven't gotten around to before.  So expect some tweaks in the coming month.</p>
