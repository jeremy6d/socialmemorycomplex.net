<p>Check out this article, <a href="http://www.freeliberal.com/archives/001005.html">Another Approach: The Democratic Freedom Caucus</a>, in <a href="http://www.freeliberal.com">The Free Liberal</a>:<blockquote>What I see now is the Democrats are a party that can change. The Republicans are in the grips of a certain ideology…it’s not free market. It should be called corporate socialism. The economic rights of corporations are recognized, but not the rights of the average person. My Republican colleagues on the Land Use Committee continue to talk about eminent domain.</blockquote></p><p>This is my prayer: Ralph Nader gets the votes of the socialists, the Republicans get the votes of the moralists, and the Democrats become the libertarians and get the votes of everybody else.</p><p>God, that would be so cool.</p>
