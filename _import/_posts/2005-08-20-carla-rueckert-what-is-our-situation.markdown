<ul>
	<li>What is the nature of the universe?
	<ul>	<li>All is one - all is love</li>
		<li>Distortions of the Law of One
		<ul>	<li>Free will</li>
			<li>Logos / light</li>
			<li>Light impressed by Love creates universe</li>
			<li>Suns, then planets, then us (sub-sub-sub-Logoi)</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Setup of planet
		<ul>	<li>1-D: space/time and time/space do not mix physically, but can be impressed</li>
			<li>2-D: space/time and time/space meet only in cell of organisms; all aware of Creator</li>
			<li>3-D: same as 2-D but people have conscious awareness of self; choice</li>
			<li>4-D: space/time and time/space fully aware of each other, conversant</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Situation on planet now
		<ul>	<li>Major cycles of 25,000+ years</li>
			<li>Now at end of major cycle</li>
			<li>Harvest is here; graduation is here</li>
			<li>4-D is being brithed NOW</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>What is the nature of myself?
	<ul>	<li>Choice Maker "ethical biological unit" at Harvest
		<ul>	<li>Most not through making first choice</li>
			<li>Of those who have chosen, most are STO</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>World around us space/time lost to heavy, repetitive situation
		<ul>	<li>Politics cycling control-empire and fall</li>
			<li>No sense to global unity</li>
			<li>Empire control of economic resources</li>
			<li>Disregard for rights of individuals</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Choices to make
		<ul>	<li>Choice of polarity in density of choice</li>
			<li>Choice of how to relate to others</li>
			<li>Choice of how to relate to space/time situation - local solutions, by individuals & groups</li>
			<li>Creation of new pattern of thought - old one cannot be fixed - break old habits</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Nature of polarity
	<ul>	<li>Change potential / unity to kinetic / choice through free will using instreaming guidance</li>
		<li>Polarity dynamic is STO and STS - radiant and magnetic
		<ul>	<li>Most souls far along before realizing nature of choice & waking up</li>
			<li>Sinkhole of indifference between 51% STO and 5% STS</li>
			<li>Nature of polarizing - 1st choice cornerstone, each further choice doubles</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Work of polarity on self level - self only, not others</li>
		<li>Work of polarity on planetary level - forming crystals</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
