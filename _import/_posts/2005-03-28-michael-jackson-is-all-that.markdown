I'm not completely insensitive to the theories that Michael Jackson is a victim of a <a href="http://aboutmichaeljackson.com/m-news+print+storyid-133-PHPSESSID-88b841ac7f710a046cea81f787848464.html">conspiracy</a> (regardless of whether or not he is guilty) but in my opinion <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050327/D893IAI00.html">this is just not a smart PR move</a>:<blockquote>However, he said he believes he is just the latest of several "black luminaries" to be unjustly accused, citing former South African President Nelson Mandela and former heavyweight boxing champions Muhammad Ali and Jack Johnson as others.</blockquote><i>Nelson Mandela</i>?  I can't believe he's comparing his situation to Nelson Mandela.  Regardless of whether he has "problems", he definately suffers from some egomania (which is quite understandable given his life - just not the molesting children part).
