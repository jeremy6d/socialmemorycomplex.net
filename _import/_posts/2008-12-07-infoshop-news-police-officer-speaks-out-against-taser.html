excerpt: Nick Dial was a police officer who volunteered to be Tasered. Since then his health has suffered to such an extent that he can no longer work. And he&#39;s not alone; other police officers have suffered serious health problems, from vertebrae misalignments to heart arrhythmia and stroke. &quot;In its video, Taser International claims that nobody has suffered a serious injury or death as a result of the Taser, but that just isn&#39;t true,&quot; says Dial.
