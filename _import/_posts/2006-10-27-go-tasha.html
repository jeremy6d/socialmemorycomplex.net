<div><a href="http://tashamckelvey.com">My wife</a> somehow got free ad space for one of her awesome <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_item.php?listing_id=523073">sushi sets</a> in the latest issue of <a href="http://www.craftzine.com/">Craft Magazine</a>.  It's situated among other fine crafts in a two-page <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a> ad near the back.  I flipped through the magazine and it's really well designed and interesting, along the same lines as <a href="http://makezine.com/">Make Magazine</a>.</div>
