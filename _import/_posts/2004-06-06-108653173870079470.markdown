Oh, yeah, and if anybody out there has any experience with software router programs, give me a holla.

Anybody ever notice that Internet Explorer problem where you enter a password, then tab down to the "Submit" or "OK" or whatever button, and when you click that button with the space bar it puts that space in the password text entry box somehow, and messes up the password?

Oh, yeah, Reagan died last night... for all his failures to deliver on his promises, he kept us out of war (probably in spite of himself) and put the "small government" idea on the table.  Too bad he never actually did anything about it, nor  did any republicans.  I think the Republican and Democratic parties are basically dead as opposing forces; they're basically just two factions of the same elite anymore.  Yeah, Steve, I know, I know, but get your own damn blog.
