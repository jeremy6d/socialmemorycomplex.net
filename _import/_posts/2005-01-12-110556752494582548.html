From the internet that brought you Craigslist:

<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/sports_skanks/">Skanks, Hos and The Men Who Inexplicably Love Them</a>

This website is cursed thrice.  Not only is it about professional sports (the pasttime of watching other people have a good time playing a game instead of you), and not only is it about gossip about professional sports star's lives (think Kobe coverage times 10,000), but it is gossip about the women who date and/or sleep with the professional sports stars.

I think the utter irrelevancy just blew my mind.  Like a time/space vortex, this site should not be able to exist in the physical universe.

But of course, even an online female smear session is entertaining.  Maybe you'll get a kick out of it.  Me, I've already got <a href="http://www.wonkette.com">Wonkette</a>, and I think I'll stick with the tramp that actually reads the newspaper - the front page, I mean, not the sports section (and even then only to scratch out the eyes of the women in the pictures who stand next to their favorite male sports ass).
