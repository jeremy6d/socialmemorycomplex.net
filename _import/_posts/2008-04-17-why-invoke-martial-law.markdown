Far easier to simply give your law enforcement personnel military vehicles, military outfits, military weapons, and a military mandate.  After all, if they scare, rough up, or hurt the population a bit, <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=928">it's a small price to pay for officer safety</a>. You can have the benefits of an occupation force with none of the pesky insurgent resistance.</p<p>The only price is our way of life. Oh, I know that's what we've spent the last century and a half fighting wars and sacrificing countless lives to protect.  But, really, wouldn't you rather your own government occupy you militarily than some other government?  I think the choice is clear.</p><p>The photo is from <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-04-15-polygamist-raid_N.htm?csp=34">the raid on the Texas polygamist sect</a>.
