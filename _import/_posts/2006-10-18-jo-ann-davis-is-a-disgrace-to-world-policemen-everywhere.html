Radley Balko gives me <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/archives/027141.php">a heads up</a> on a Congresswoman from my old congressional district (the 1st) who has astounded me in her abject ignorance:
<blockquote>Representative Jo Ann Davis, a Virginia Republican who heads a House intelligence subcommittee charged with overseeing the C.I.A.'s performance in recruiting Islamic spies and analyzing information, was similarly dumbfounded when I asked her if she knew the difference between Sunnis and Shiites.

"Do I?" she asked me. A look of concentration came over her face. "You know, I should." She took a stab at it: "It's a difference in their fundamental religious beliefs. The Sunni are more radical than the Shia. Or vice versa. But I think it's the Sunnis who're more radical than the Shia."</blockquote>
I love that: "Do I?"  Jeez, if you're going to break up fights in the countries you occupy, shouldn't you know what the hell they're about?

At least I can pat myself on the back for fighting her election back in 2000 by working on the campaign of the Libertarian candidate, Sharon Wood - including lobbying for her to actually be included in the first congressional district debate hosted by my school.  I actually had to go in front of some committee and explain why they should allow all the candidates in the race to participate (I think <a href="http://www.umw.edu/archive_mwc/news/mrg/farnsworth.htm">this asshole</a> had a lot to do with it).
