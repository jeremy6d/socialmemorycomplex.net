<p>This is from an old favorite of mine, <a href="http://choosewisely.blogspot.com/2008/04/tax-day.html">Weapon of Choice</a>:<blockquote><p>Did y'all get your taxes done? Congratulations to liberals for unwillingly funding an illegal war and to conservatives for unwillingly funding bleeding heart social programs. We all win!</p></blockquote>Good to see you're keepin' on keepin' on, R.</p>
