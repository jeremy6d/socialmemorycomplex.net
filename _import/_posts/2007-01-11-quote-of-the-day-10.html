Rad Geek <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/2006/12/15/the-doors-of-perception/#comment-566">shares my opinion</a> of Bob Barr's possible 2008 Presidential Run on the LP ticket:
<blockquote>If they want someone really prominent for the 2008 presidential race, maybe they could drop Bob Barr to the VP slot, and instead nominate the exhumed corpse of Augusto Pinochet. Minor disagreements aside, he does have lots of name recognition. Plus I hear heâ€™s for privatizing Social Security.</blockquote>
The sad thing is <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/006032.asp">how</a> <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts189.html">many</a> <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2006/12/28/meditations-on-the-killing-of-commies/">libertarians</a> actually do carry water for Pinochet.  How the principled have fallen.
