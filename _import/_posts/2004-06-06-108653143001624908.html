Everybody shut up.  Listen - I just had the best sushi last night.  It's <strong>philadelphia roll, deep fried in tempura batter</strong>!  Damn that was good.  The only thing better than that is yellowtail sashimi, and that's way too expensive.

There should be some sort of protection against letting your high class tastes outpace your ability to afford them.  Anybody know where you can find sashimi grade yellowtail in the Bum Fuck Egypt area?
