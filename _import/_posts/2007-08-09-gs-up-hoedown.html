<p>Welp, here's the update on my professional life.  I'm working on three contracts, so money is coming in. Hopefully, this money will make the search for a new employer less urgent and allow me to be picky.  Additionally, one of these gigs is going to be a fast-paced, agilely developed Rails application for a new political action committee (what's the emoticon for irony?).  I'm excited.</p><p>Of course, in the next month or two I'd like to find a full-time job.  My ideal position is a small, agile organization where people play roles when necessary instead of clinging to titles. I'd like to play more of a lead developer role - it's high time for me to stop simply taking orders and start participating in a greater diversity of architectural, business, and strategic decisions in the software biz.  For a long time, I've felt I've had too much yet to learn to take on a great deal of responsibility.  No more - I'm ready.</p><p>If Tasha and I were better positioned financially, I might go it my own, but it's just as well - I could stand a bit more experience.  And I still intend to continue freelancing on the side, so I can take the move to self-employment gradually.  But it's been absolutely exhilarating to see how much opportunity is out there, and anyway I was getting too complacent for my own good.  Only risks yield the big rewards in the market.</p><p>Tomorrow I'm headed down to Raleigh with my buds from the <a href="http://cvreg.org">Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts Group</a> (site's down) for the <a href="http://rubyhoedown.com">Ruby Hoedown</a> where I hope to meet some interesting people and learn about non-Rails applications of Ruby.  I've already been using Ruby to write scripts for a friend's business, and it's a blast.  I'm particularly hoping to talk to somebody about cross-platform GUI libraries for desktop app development with Ruby.  If you're there, holla atcha boy.</p>
