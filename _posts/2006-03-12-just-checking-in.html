<p>I really don't have any excuse for being away so long.  I've been working pretty hard, and when I'm not working I'm relaxing.  Got some chores done this weekend and got some reading out of the way.  I'm kicking around some draft posts, just haven't gotten any of them good enough yet.</p><p>So until I get you a decent post, go read <a href="http://blogcritics.org/archives/2006/03/05/165927.php">this article</a> about RSS if you're don't know what it is - it will change the way you use the internet</p>
