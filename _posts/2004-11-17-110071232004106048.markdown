From <a href="http://www.davidbrin.blogspot.com/">David Brin's wonderful blog</a> (which I'm just starting to explore) a great H.L. Mencken quote:<blockquote>On July 26, 1920 HL Mencken wrote the following in the Baltimore Evening Sun :

"As democracy is perfected, the office of president represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron."</blockquote>I think the term "moron" is a bit harsh, because the plain folks got not only an unexceptional intellect but an unpretentious one.  And I think that second feature is what is important to them.  

Brin's also got <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/neoromantics.html">a great essay</a> on the nature of this new Republican wierdness that has emerged at his <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com">site</a>.  I plan on posting my comments on it later.  I also want to post more thoughts about the value/culture war on which we libertarians have unique insight, I believe.
