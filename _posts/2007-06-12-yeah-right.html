<p>Fool me <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/667">once</a>, shame on you.  Fool me <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/25/democrats.wardebate.ap/index.html">twice</a>, shame on me.  So why should we believe you <a href="http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=180856&s=&i=&t=US_Democrats_preview_new_Iraq_showdown">a third time</a>, Democrats?<blockquote><p>"On Iraq, we're going to hold the president's feet to the fire," said Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, saying debate would start in two weeks time.</p><p>Less than a month after bowing to Bush's demands and approving a 100 billion dollar war budget, Democratic leaders pledged a new challenge to the White House on withdrawal timelines, troop readiness and curtailing the president's authority to continue the fight.</p><p>Reid said however that Democrats, saddled with a thin majority in Congress, had raised unrealistic expectations about their ability to end the war, among supporters who powered their takeover of Congress last year.</p><p>"We set the bar too high," he said, noting that under Senate rules, Democrats needed 60 votes in the 100 seat chamber to thwart Republican blocking tactics.</p></blockquote><p>Well that's great for you and all, but you lied.</p><p>Does it surprise me?  No.  Are people's lives at stake?  Fuck, yes, you shifty bastards.</p>
