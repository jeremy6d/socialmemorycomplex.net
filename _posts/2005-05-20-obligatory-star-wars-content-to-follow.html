<p>You can read some thoughts of mine <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.typepad.com/right_thinking_girl/2005/05/the_grenade_mea.html#c5754671">here</a> and in the comments <a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=10198102&postID=111653394960416399">here</a>.  All I'll say on my blog is this: consider that Luke uses the same idea to turn Vader against the Emperor as Palpatine uses to turn Anakin to the Dark Side.</p><p>Now, you think about that long and hard.  Seriously, Star Wars has one of the best allegories about good and evil that exists in modern popular culture.  It's just too bad that Lucas has no subtlety whatsoever.</p>
