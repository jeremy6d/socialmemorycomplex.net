Top 5 things you say when you forget your lines on the set of Fox's <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> (a list some coworkers and I came up with):
<ul>
	<li>We don't have time!!!</li>
	<li>I understand how you must feel, but I need you to concentrate...</li>
	<li>I'll open a socket. (<em>note: As a computer professional, that makes no sense whatsoever)</em></li>
	<li>I'll set up a protocol. (<em>note: what the hell does that even mean? By season 4 I was damn sure the writers were just making up cool words to use)</em></li>
	<li>(...don't say anything, just hang up the phone - because the first unbreakable rule of <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> is that you <strong>never, ever, never ever ever </strong>say "bye" when you want to end a call)</li>
</ul>
Don't get me wrong, <a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a> rocks my world, but... it's a strange experience to glorify the state's worst tendencies. Let's just say I don't consider Jack Bauer a nice guy. It's kinda of like watching Star Wars and rooting for the Empire.
