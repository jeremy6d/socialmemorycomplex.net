Last night I attended an initial planning meeting at <a href="http://capitalalehouse.com">Capital Ale House</a> for a Ruby users group in Richmond.  My friend and coworker <a href="http://jimvanfleet.com">Jim Van Fleet</a> organized it, and we had a pretty good turnout.  It's funny because a few hours before the meeting I didn't know if anything was happening, and it ended up that we had an attendence of about 8 or 9 people.  It was great to see the people in the flesh excited about Ruby, and I'm thrilled to have some smart people to bounce ideas off of and learn from.

We're calling ourselves the Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts Group, and we should have a domain and site up soon.  We're planning on having our next meeting on October 7, 2006 at a location to be announced.  We've brainstormed and come up with some cool ideas like codejams and beginners presentations.  I'm stoked!
