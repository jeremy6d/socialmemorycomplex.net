<blockquote><p>As I see it, the doctrines of democracy deal with the aspirations of men's souls, but the application deals with things. One hand in somebody else's pocket and one on your gun, and you are highly civilized. Desire enough for your own use only, and you are a heathen. Civilized people have things to show the neighbors.</p></blockquote><p align=right>- <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/2008/07/28/watching-god-from-the-palace-of-skulls/">Zora Neale Hurston</a></p>
