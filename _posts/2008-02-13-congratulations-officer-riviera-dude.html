<p>You just disrespected yourself, your badge, and the <a href="http://www.baltimorepolice.org/">Baltimore Police Department</a> way more than any punk kid.  Dude.</p><p align=center><object width="425" height="373"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/9GgWrV8TcUc&rel=1&border=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/9GgWrV8TcUc&rel=1&border=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="373"></embed></object></p><p>Did you catch the veiled death threat from the <s>dude</s> officer? And the way it ends is the best. "Is that camera on?  If I find myself on - *click*".</p><p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/02/12/respect-his-authori-tah/">Mr. Balko</a>.</p><p>UPDATE 1: Apparently, <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_city/bal-officer0211,0,6130830.story?page=1">the cop has been suspended</a>, but I'm sure he'll be back on the force in no time once the review board finds that "official procedures were followed."  And listen to the police union guy:<blockquote><p>Paul Blair, head of the police union, had not seen the video but cautioned that videos show only a slice of a story. He noted that it is impossible to know what happened before or after the camera was turned on.</p></blockquote>I'd like to know, Mr. Blair: what could possibly have happened before the camera came on that would have excused such behavior on the part of the officer?  No, really, your wildest fantasy - give me a scenario where it would have served the BPD to have that dude act like that. And this is great:<blockquote><p>Clifford said the boy never made an official complaint to the Police Department and that Rivieri has no other citizen complaints in his file.</p></blockquote>That's the excuse I love from police departments.  If you don't make a complaint, it didn't happen.  You have to jump through <em>their</em> hoops after <em>they</em> physically and verbally assault you, just so they can have a chance to get their story straight before they dismiss you utterly.  No, no - I think YouTube is far superior.</p><p>UPDATE 2: In <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=897#comment-91710">the comments below</a>, John alerts readers to <a href="http://www.abc2news.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=4f8b7c0f-6d4a-47b7-9e9b-569803ea7db8">another video of Rivieri out of control</a>.  Thanks, John!</p>
