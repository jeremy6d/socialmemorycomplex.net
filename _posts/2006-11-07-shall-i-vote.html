Even though <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=570">I thought I was decided</a> on the matter, <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">certain</a> <a href="http://radgeek.com">people</a> have encouraged me to rethink my justifications for abstaining from the vote.  Although I do feel it is immoral to participate in a process that appoints a representative who can use force against you, Charles Johnson brought up <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=570#comment-20456">an interesting counterargument</a>:
<blockquote>Well, I think the problem here is that you're giving too much credit to the State's own legitimating myths. There are cases in which participating in a process means tacitly accepting the legitimacy of the proceeding, and tacitly consenting to the outcome. But voting, at least, is not among them. <strong>For participation to count as consent, even tacit consent, it must be the case that <em>refusing</em> to participate would have exempted you from the outcome.</strong> Otherwise, I can't see how the “permission” you give to the government by voting is any different from the “permission” you give a mugger to take your money instead of your life when you hand over your wallet.</blockquote>
That is a good point, although <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=570#comment-20523">I argued</a> that what matters was how my vote was perceived socially vis a vis my long term goal of abolishing the State.  It also raises the question: how should I regard my participation if I do vote?  I don't feel it's honest to say that I'm simply taking part in a meaningless ritual - clearly, it's important or I would not go out of my way to do it.  I don't like the self-defense argument, because it still implies that I'm participating in a mechanism for oppression - whether or not my consent is given - and that betrays the sense of solidarity that I feel anarchists should embrace and promote.

However, I can't deny that this election is important.  Allen is absolutely and totally unacceptable, and there's been worse politicians than Webb.  Furthermore, I really think that voting against the marriage amendment to the Virginia constitution is not nearly as awful as voting for a politician.  Honestly, I wish I had more time to turn these matters over in my head, and since there's only today I have to act, I'm leaning towards going to the polls.

What do you think I should do?  If you read this blog, you know a lot of my principles and opinions.  Given that, which is the best course for me to take?  I wish I was better decided on this matter, and hate to throw these questions out like this, but I am interested in persuasive arguments.
<ol>
	<li>Abstain from the vote entirely.</li>
	<li>Vote only on the marriage amendment.</li>
	<li>Vote on both the amendment and the senate seat.</li>
</ol>
