<p>Since I used to produce amateur electronic music, mostly drum and bass / jungle (you can sample some of my work <a href="http://significator.net">here</a>) I'm very familiar with the prevalence and importance of the Amen break.  So it's cool to see a short documentary that can chronicle its adventures and tie it into free culture and the tyranny of intellectual property law.</p><div align=center><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5SaFTm2bcac&hl=en&fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5SaFTm2bcac&hl=en&fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object></div>
