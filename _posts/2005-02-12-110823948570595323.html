Oh, God.  <a href="">This fucked up article</a> was in Tasha's hometown paper.  Try to remember that where she's from has like 10,000 people and is one of the larger counties in Virginia.<blockquote>Last week, Gloucester Game Warden Timothy Worrell warned local educators and youth advisors that gangs and their related criminal activity are headed this way.</blockquote>Yeah, the <i>Game Warden</i>.  He explains what the hell he knows about gangs:<blockquote>Worrell said his agency, the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, became aware of the gang problem when an officer in Northern Virginia responded to a complaint about a group hanging out at a public boat ramp. When the officer arrived, Worrell said he was cornered by 35-40 Hispanic men and was forced to make a run for his truck. Cornered in his vehicle, the officer had to pull out a machine gun to hold the gang members at bay until 10 to 12 other officers came to his aid. "That's when game wardens got involved," he explained.</blockquote>Un-fucking-believable.  "That's when game wardens got involved."  How about that's when game wardens needed to get a bigger budget?  What an idiot.
