<p>I'm sure that if you're into left libertarianism, you probably <a href="http://leftlibertarian.org/2008/03/27/forumleftlibertarianorg-is-up/">already know</a> that <a href="http://forum.leftlibertarian.org">the forum</a> at leftlibertarian.org is up.  But if you're not into it and curious, check it out!  The point is to start to organize and more widely represent the online conversation surrounding this approach to libertarianism.</p><p>I'm actually really excited about having gotten <a href="http://bbpress.org">bbpress</a>, the forum based on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, integrated with the aggregator.  I'm still trying to get <a href="http://bbpress.org/plugins/topic/bbsync/">bbsync</a> to automatically start threads for posts syndicated on the leftlibertarian.org site.  I'd like, eventually, to get things going the other way, too: to have the community post articles in the forum that get syndicated by the aggregator.  The end goal is to have a site that manages a common content pool with several ways for viewing and interacting with it.  I'm working on custom software to realize this goal, but the bbpress/WordPress integration tools are quite compelling.</p>
