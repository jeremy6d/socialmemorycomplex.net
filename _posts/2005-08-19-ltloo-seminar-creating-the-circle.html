<p>We just had a wonderful meal.  Chicken cordon blue, roast beef and mashed potatoes, green beans, salad.  This place is beautiful - right on a gorgeous lake.  There were doe running in the field and wild turkeys right outside.  Gorgeous.</p><p>Now comes the part of the seminar where everybody talks about their experiences up to this point to introduce themselves and their path.  I'm running the camera and it's in the middle of the circle - and I'm on to turn it around, so I better run.  More to come!</p>
