Got any? Looking for something that runs small and allows me to download lots simultaneously. I've always used the <a href="http://www.bittorrent.com/">original client</a> and there might be something better out there. Looks like <a href="http://bittornado.com/">BitTornado</a> is pretty nice. Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Sorry I don't have more details about what I'm looking for - now that I have access to broadband at both work and home, I should be able to take advantage of this.

BTW, got any torrent site recommendations as well?
