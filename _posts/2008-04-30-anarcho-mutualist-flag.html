<p><img src='/assets/anarcho-mutualism.png' style="border: 1px solid white" />Based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist_symbolism#Bisected_flags_and_stars">these flags</a>, would this not be the fitting flag for mutualists, given their sort of middle ground between the market anarchists (who do yellow) and the syndicalists / socialists (who do red)?</p><p>Meh, it was mostly just a chance to play around with Inkscape.  As always, your thoughts are welcome.  I'm big on the plain ol' black, myself.</p>
