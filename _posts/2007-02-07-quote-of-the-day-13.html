<img style="margin: 3px; float: right" src="http://leap.cc/images/peterchrist.jpg' /><a href="http://leap.cc/Speakers/speakerbio.php?spkr=./Bios/christ.inc&name=Peter%20Christ">Peter Christ</a> of <a href="http://leap.cc">Law Enforcement Against Prohibition</a> has some unique and novel insights into the War on Drugs, but I found this excerpt from <a href="http://mapinc.org/newsleap/v06/n312/a04.html">an interview</a> pretty humorous:
<blockquote>Do you know what is the first prohibition we have any record of? "Do not eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil." Also, I'd like to point out, that was the first example of zero tolerance.  There were no exceptions; you couldn't take a little bite from the apple and stay in the garden.  Take one bite and you're out.

How many people had to be watched to make that prohibition work? Two.  And who was the cop for the prohibition? God.  Now if any prohibition was ever going to work, wouldn't that have been the one? But it failed.</blockquote>
Tons of other great thoughts in that interview. It's great to see a cop break with the stereotype and actually approach his discipline with the thoughtfulness and humility it deserves.
