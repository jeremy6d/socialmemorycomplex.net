I think [this](http://letters.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2011/04/17/signing_statements/permalink/46e09c751a1dc709be30fc322e64a9b9.html) is probably one of my favorite exchanges ever:

>> I guess you see your role as speaking truth to power, whoever happens to be in power. Which I can appreciate. The world definitely needs people like that.

>What's the alternative? Flattering and cheering for power when it's on your side, no matter what it does?

The [article](http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/04/17/signing_statements/index.html) Greenwald wrote is good, too.
