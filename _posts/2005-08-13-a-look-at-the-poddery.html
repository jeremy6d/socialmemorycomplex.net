<p><div align=center><img src="pics/pottery.jpg"/></div></p><p>Last weekend was spent the way many of my weekends are: at <a href="http://thepoddery.artroof.com">the Poddery</a> while Tasha is doing her work.  This particular day she was working on the wedding favors, so since it had something remotely to do with me, I offered to help.  She is fashioning ceramic ginkgo leaves for the guests, since we have a ginkgo leaf theme going.  I took some pictures to illustrate some aspects of making ceramic objects and show the process.  Plus, I talk so much about Tasha's work, and you deserve to see the frickin' place.</p><div align=center><p><img src="pics/gingko1.jpg"/>This rolling press is used to flatten the clay to make slabs, from which pieces are cut.<br /></p><p><div align=center><img src="pics/gingko2.jpg"/>We then stamped the pieces with a linoleum carving Tasha made.<br /></div></p><p><div align=center><img src="pics/gingko4.jpg"/>The stamped pieces were trimmed to shape.<br /></div></p><p><img src="pics/gingko3.jpg"/>We did a lot of them.<br /></p><p><img src="pics/gingko5.jpg"/>When they're glazed and fired, this is what they end up looking like!</p></div>
