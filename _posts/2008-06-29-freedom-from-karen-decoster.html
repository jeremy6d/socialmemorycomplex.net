<p>Karen DeCoster <a href="http://www.karendecoster.com/blog/archives/002928.html">has</a> <a href="http://www.karendecoster.com/blog/archives/002925.html">opinions</a>.  Isn't that adorable?</p><p>If I may elaborate further, I think it's fucking awesome that people find ways to live without bosses, disposable income, and the general bullshit that goes along with mainstream society.  That's freedom! I aspire to find a way to do meaningful, fulfilling work that pays my essential expenses of living in less than 40 hours a week one day, so I can concentrate on activism, writing, and leisure more.</p><p>I don't think you could propose a more freedom-oriented approach to life than living off the foolish waste and excess of the self-important, upwardly-crawling corporate yuppie.  Part of me wants to find ways to dig through DeCoster's trash, just to piss her off.  And given that the corporate culture DeCoster so cherishes working for has (A) mooched off the public for decades, and (B) long manipulated the level of unemployment through the Fed for elite benefit, I think there's a certain poetic justice in living on unemployment and welfare at the expense of overprivileged snobs like DeCoster.</p><p>By the way, when I was laid off, I filed for unemployment.  It was so meager I didn't even bother collecting.  Now I wish I had; there's gotta be a way I can charge my bumming directly to her paycheck, isn't there?  That may be a bit hypocritical for a libertarian to say, but if it distances me from DeCoster's brand of careerist libertarianism, it's a small price to pay.</p>
