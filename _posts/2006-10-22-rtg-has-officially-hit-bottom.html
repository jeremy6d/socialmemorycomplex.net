First it was self-righteous anger, then bigotry, then outright paranoia.  How do you top that?

Now Right Thinking Girl has <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com/2006/10/20/welcome-to-my-world/">a messiah complex</a>:
<blockquote>...I've created my own religion.  It is so new that it doesn't have a name yet but basically it is a mix of Objectivism, patriotism, Christianity, and anti-Islam.  I'm not a priest;  I have no special knowledge about how to get you closer to God.  I can tell you what has worked for me and maybe it will work for you too.  Mostly that includes yoga and making some art.

But the point is, my religion is political.  All religions must be political now, and mine is the first to be openly anti-Islam.  It was created to push back against Islamists, and to help followers discover within themselves the desire to survive, both literally and culturally.</blockquote>
I've been sitting at the computer for an hour, trying to think of something insightful to say, but I got nothing.
