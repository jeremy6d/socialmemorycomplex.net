I'm thinking of bringing the Wrong Thinking Girl site back.  I would have thought nobody cared about what I thought of another blogger, and I considered most of my posts on RTG's posts self-indulgent and harmless fun when they weren't making more overt points about braindead conservatism.  As it turns out, I've had far more positive feedback than negative.

Now, I'm not one to make decisions based on popularity, but the recent interest seems like it validates a site unto itself.  Although I took the site down as a show of good faith towards RTG that I was not trying to be mean, I've since decided that I don't really care.  Given that, the idea for the original site once again makes sense.

Keep in mind that the original idea was to have more than one person make fun of <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com">Right Thinking Girl</a>, so I'd need (OK, I'd <em>like</em>) some backup support.  I won't be offended in the least if nobody gives a rat's ass.  That said: care to open this can of worms?

Everybody is welcome to comment except Russ.  Russ, I know how you feel.
