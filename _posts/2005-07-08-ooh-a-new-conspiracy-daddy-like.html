<p>Apparently, there are grumblings that the Israelis had advance knowledge of the London bombings!  Justin Raimondo of <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/blog/">antiwar.com</a> takes a look at things:<blockquote><p>In denying widespread reports that Israeli Finance Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received a warning of the London terrorist attacks "minutes before" they occurred, Israeli Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom claims that "After the first explosion, our finance minister received a request not to go anywhere."</p><p>The problem with this explanation is that it was only after the third explosion that London police realized they were in the midst of a terrorist attack. Up until that point, authorities thought they were dealing with a series of accidents caused by a power surge...</p><p>...If Netanyahu was told a terrorist attack was underway after the first explosion – which everyone, including the police, thought was due to a power surge – then that's a lot more than the victims of the subsequent explosions were told as they rode the Tube to their doom. Which means the Foreign Minister's explanation – Netanyahu was told to stay in his hotel room after the first explosion, rather than show up at the Israeli economic conference at a hotel near Liverpool station – is entirely consistent with the claim that he was tipped off to what was really going on, while the rest of the city stumbled into disaster and, in some cases, death.</p></blockquote></p><p>Interesting - read more <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/blog/comments.php?id=P2206_0_1_0">here</a>.</p>
