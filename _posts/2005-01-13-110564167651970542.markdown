When I first saw <a href="http://drudgereport.com">Drudge</a> today, I thought the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4170083.stm">headline</a> "UK ROCKED" was really lame.  More fretting about the royal family that I could care less about.  But Drudge also linked to a story about the <a href="http://www.thisislondon.com/news/articles/15924727?source=Evening%20Standard">royal family's historic ties to Germany</a> that was cool, since a lot has been said of late about  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1312540,00.html">Nazi links to today's political leaders</a>.

I just think it's cool that conspiracy theories are being taken a little more seriously than usual.

This has gotta be some kind of record.  Four posts in one day?!?!  And only one cup of coffee!!!  Take that, <a href="http://www.somewhatsilent.com">Sara</a>!  :-)
