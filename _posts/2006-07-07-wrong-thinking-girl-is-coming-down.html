<p>I apologize to anybody who was offended by the site.  I take full responsibility for it, even though I didn't anticipate the response.  I will be moving all the posts to this blog and redirecting WTG.com to RTG.com.</p><p>However, I was sorely disappointed by the response from RTG and her minions, and just about all the people who I respect on the site saw things my way (I can accept a difference of opinion on the part of Russ and Gon).  I thought her reaction was juvenile and gave me zero credit for being a loyal reader, participant, and friend.  She apparently thinks us readers owe her everything and she owes us nothing in return - including response to critiques of her writing in her comments, which is the reason I started the WTG.com blog in the first place.</p><p>I made an error, but at least I can admit it, since I am NOT "mean spirited".  I can't say the same for RTG.  I made a peace overture and it was ignored, so at this point I'm convinced that she's no longer worth my time.  So much for "internet friends" - at least I made some good ones while I was there.</p><p>Here's my final post there, <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com/2006/07/06/ann-coulter-quotes-from-godless/#comment-5266">in case it's taken down</a>:<blockquote><p>Just FYI, the WTG.com site is coming down.  I'm sorry if I hurt anybody's feelings.  I honestly did not anticipate that.  I wish I could have gotten a little benefit of the doubt, though.  But to truly answer your question, Russ, I haven't felt like "family" here in a long time... and this place isn't the same as the old site.</p><p>However, I will continue to critique RTG's writing on my own blog and refrain from spending time posting comments here.  Despite what she thinks, her ideas are going out to a wider conversation simply by virtue of being published, and I intend to react to them as we all do, though maybe not on the narrow terms she sets.  It's my opinion that her sense of ownership of our participation discredits the strength of her ideas.</p><p>The sense of entitlement felt by the host absolutely extinguishes any passion I have to come here.  I admit that I acted improperly - what matters isn't my intentions, apparently, but whether I take responsibility for the consequences, which I do - but I'm afraid RTG's reaction has lowered my opinion of her and this site.  It remains a source of satisfaction, however, that RTG felt she could not compete with liberals in a larger venue with an equal voice for all - and that, in the end, I left not because she's wrong, but because she exposed herself as nothing but a paranoid control freak (and worse).</p></blockquote></p><p>UPDATE: I just want to make clear that regardless of who's right or wrong, I made some bad decisions and handled things poorly, and I apologize again to anybody who was hurt by anything I did.  This isn't how I pictured things going.</p>
