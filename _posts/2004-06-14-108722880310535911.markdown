I had fun kayaking this weekend.  I need more physical activity in my life.  Maybe we can go backpacking again soon (my favorite activity that burns calories besides, well, never mind).  BTW, here's a pic of me and Tasha backpacking in Alaska last summer.

Yes, that stream is fed by pure glacier water.  Fucking gorgeous out there.
