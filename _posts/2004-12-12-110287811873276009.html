By the way, after looking over <a href="http://6thdensity.net/blog/2004/12/why-do-conservatives-not-acknowledge.html">this post</a> again, I realize it's not entirely fair.  Liberals don't usually acknowledge the consequences of our past foreign policy, either.  Basically we have an establishment that will twist whatever facts and logic they have to in order to make it seem that all this "just happened to us", regardless of the role we have played in the world.

It just boggles my mind.  We constantly have it shoved down our throats that we're a superpower with peculiar "responsibilities" in the world.  In pursuit of these unprecedented obligations (self-assumed, alleged obligations I might add), we have had to be involved in every single issue and dispute on the planet.  Yet, somehow when the shit hits the fan, we had nothing to do with it.  Magic - you can do anything you want with no accountability for long term consequences.

<b>How</b> can you have it both ways?
