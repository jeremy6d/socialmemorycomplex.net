<p><img width="440" height="330" alt="Tela at work" id="image618" style="margin: 3px; float: left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/02/IMAGE_00043.jpg' />Last night the furnace broke (for the second time).  It was 17 degrees outside, so it got cold in the house.  I didn't want to leave Tela at home today while we're waiting for the landlord to fix it, so I brought her to work.  Of course, she was quite a star, but development work makes her really tired.</p><p>(Had to take this on my camera phone; sorry for the crappy quality)</p>
