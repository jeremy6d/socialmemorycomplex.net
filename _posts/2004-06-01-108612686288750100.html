<p>Just FYI, the <a href="http://www.lp.org">Libertarian Party</a> <a href="http://www.lp.org/press/archive.php?function=view&amp;record=661">picked it's nominee for the 2004 Presidential Race</a>.  Good for them.  The winner, Badnarik, seems like a good guy - a little bookish, but I guess that makes him a pretty faithful representative of the party.  If he can come off as not being a pretentious snob devoid of any social skills whatsoever, he's already doing better than some of the LPs membership.</p>
<p>See, as you can tell, I'm not a huge fan of the LP.  Well, I'm a BIG fan of libertarianism, and I even support the LP mostly, but the people actually IN the LP can be so fucking annoying.  I was on the State Central Committee for a state LP that went through a big political feud over trying to oust the Party Chairman, and it was just stupid posturing, backbiting, and slick maneuvering over, what, 1% of the electorate?  Hardly a big enough piece of the pie to get bent out of shape over.</p>
<p>They call themselves the "Party of Principle", but I think they could stand to lighten up on the "principle" part.  Being the party of principle doesn't mean shoving *your* principles and self-righteousness down everybody else's throat, Christ.  The LP needs to get their fucking act together before they get anymore of my money.</p>
<p>I just read Paul Hawken's <em>The Ecology of Commerce</em> which is all about how businesses must become not just eco-friendly, but design their businesses for long term sustainability.  Sounds pretty libertarian, I'll do a post on libertarian environmentalism in a bit.</p>
