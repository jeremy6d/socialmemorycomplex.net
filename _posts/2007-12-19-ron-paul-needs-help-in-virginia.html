<p>The Ron Paul campaign is not well organized in Virginia, and time is running out prior to the primary.  We need Virginians to step up to the plate and act <em>yesterday</em>, but now will have to do (hey, I just got involved in the last week, too).  There are some real hurdles to cross in Virginia because of the way the Republicans run their caucuses.  That's why we need to get people coordinated.</p><p>So if you want to help us out, great!  Putting up signs helps.  Talking to your friends, family, and neighbors helps.  However, we are going to need to coordinate our actions on a pretty massive scale in order to get Ron Paul nominated by Virginia Republicans.</p>Therefore, if you are in this for Ron Paul, we desperately require that you do two simple things:<ol><li><em>Go to <a href="http://paulsparachute.com">Paul's Parachute</a> and sign up there.</em>  Check it regularly for announcements.  We're working on better tools with which to organize ourselves, but for now this simple forum will do.  Make sure your screenname is your real name, so we can begin getting to know one another.</li><li><em>Join your local Republican party</em> so you have a chance of becoming a delegate.  We need delegates to send to the convention to nominate Ron Paul.  The way the party's bylaws work in Virginia is that the delegates are only required to vote for the winner of the Virginia Primary on the first ballot.  After that, they can vote for whomever they want.  That means it's very important that we have people who are backing Paul at the convention, so do your part.  If you're in Henrico like me, go <a href="gop.com/membership.html">here</a>, print out and fill out the PDF membership form, and send it in along with your $20 fee.</li></ol>BTW, just was notified that the <a href="http://www.ronpaulblimp.com/">blimp</a> flew over Richmond today. Huzzah!</p>
