<p>It's not really a whole quote, just a fragment of a sentence, but it was poetic enough to choke me up just a little bit.  It's from Roderick Long's <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/2007/11/04/death-in-venice/">review</a> of the Commissario Brunetti murder mysteries by Donna Leon:<blockquote><p>When in the course of his investigations Brunetti comes across evidence of tax evasion or violation of various petty regulations, he always ignores it, <em>identifying less with the state apparatus than with the vast informal fraternity of ordinary people trying to get on with their peaceful lives.</em></p></blockquote>The only times I feel like this world might turn out ok are when I get a glimpse of how beautiful and perfect that fraternity is, made all the more special because of how often we drive it from our minds.</p>
