	<li>My brother John got home from Iraq about three or four weeks ago.  Obviously, that's a big relief.  Finally got to see him briefly last weekend at a cookout his wife's family was having.  We didn't get a chance to talk much, but he definitely wants to give me some insight into what's going on there.  I'm just glad he's safe.</li>
	<li>Tasha's ten year high school reunion was last night.  It was a lot of fun; got to hang out with some people I hadn't seen in a while.  Unfortunately, I think I knew more people at her reunion than I'll know at mine...</li>
	<li><a href="http://jimvanfleet.com">Jim Van Fleet</a>'s generosity has resulted in a recent intensive economic and policy education.  He loaned me a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Undercover-Economist-Exposing-Poor-Decent/dp/0195189779/sr=8-1/qid=1160946114/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-7273805-2353760?ie=UTF8&s=books">Tim Hartford</a> book a while ago that was insightful, if a little infuriating (yes, in a perfect market, <a href="http://www.mutualist.org/id106.html">price does indeed equal cost</a>... so don't you wonder what the source of all that distortion is, <a href="http://www.timharford.com/biography.htm">Mr. World Bank</a>?).  Now I'm reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Secrets-Temple-Federal-Reserve-Country/dp/0671675567/sr=8-1/qid=1160945841/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7273805-2353760?ie=UTF8">Secrets of the Temple</a> by William Greider.  I simply can't put it down - I've never read such a captivating narrative about economic policy.  Of course, the kicker is that - as Ted Kennedy says on the back cover - what passes for dispassionate, expert management of the economy is in actual fact intensely political.  There is a passage that deals with the transformation of American society from its rural agrarian roots to hypermanaged city life that was really touching to this decentralist.  Its regular investigations of the interests at work in Fed policy make it a very even-handed book, if framed by an establishment point of view.  It will certainly inform a lot of my future explorations of economics (as well as many beer-fueled discussions with Jim).</li>
	<li>Another friend of mine is working on doing a low budget indie zombie flick starring all his friends.  It's going to be intentionally cheezy, of course, but I've been invited to do a song or two for the soundtrack.  I've got a few ideas in mind... I've normally stayed away from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkside_jungle">dark, evil jungle</a>, but this would be a good chance to tap into the dark side.  I'm also gonna see if <a href="http://acidlogic.com/blogger/">Wil</a> wants to contribute a track, since this sounds right up his alley.</li>
	<li>I need advice on time management, self-discipline, and stuff like that.  I'm tired of always procrastinating stuff.  I've gotten to the point where I'm used to being overwhelmed, and I need to find a way to discipline myself to do things when they need to be done.  And to <em>expect </em>myself to do them.</li>
