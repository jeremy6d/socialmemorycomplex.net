<p><a href="http://www.donotremove.net/mexigogue/">Mexigogue</a> makes <a href="http://www.donotremove.net/mexigogue/archives/003672.html">a good point</a>, the subject of which I'm usually too nice to comment:<blockquote>They're everywhere. . . People who are dumb but do not know it. People who are exceptionally bad at something and keep right on plugging along, oblivious to the fact that that other people are jamming fingers in their ears at their singing, cringing at their jokes, or shaking their heads at their pool shots. I don't mean just kind of bad. I mean people who fall into the bottom 15th percentile of something and bop around like they're good enough to be consultants at their particular area of "skill."</blockquote><p>It gets better; read it.</p>
