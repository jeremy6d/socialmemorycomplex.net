<a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=48460603">Check them out.</a>  This is a side project of Tom Hamilton of <a href="http://www.brotherspast.com">Brothers Past</a> (I've written about them <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?cat=7">here</a>).  There's two downloads on there for what I can only hope will be a forthcoming studio release.  Looks like Aaron Magner from <a href="http://discobiscuits.com">the Disco Biscuits</a> is playing keys for them, too.  Very different than his or Tom's other work - I encourage you to listen to it.
