<p>Well, I've put the update on my life off for far too long, time to come clean.  As of Tuesday I am working for a D.C.-based web development firm that is focusing on Ruby and Rails.  I get to work from home in Richmond and the work I'm doing is some pretty cutting edge stuff - <a href="http://rspec.rubyforge.org/index.html">rspec</a>, <a href="http://behaviour-driven.org/">behavior driven development</a>, <a href="http://acts-as-solr.rubyforge.org/">acts_as_solr</a>, <a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">mocha</a> - hotness.  I'm very happy with the situation.</p><p>I should also mention that Tasha doubled what was till then her all time sales record at the <a href="http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/craftybastards/">Crafty Bastard</a> show in D.C.  It worked out well for me to go up with her because (a) she needed the help - at one time she had a line going out her booth of young, hip people buying her stuff - and (b) I got to have coffee with my present boss.  Plus I had ethiopian food for breakfast - and it was delicious!</p><p>Not only that, I also found out that the guys who led the political action committee project I just came off of are interested in doing some  for-profit things with the codebase.  The cool thing is that I'm already a partner without even having to work on the code ever again!</p><p>Also, the 2nd Annual McWeiland Chili Cookoff will be held October 20th.  Invites are going out soon, but if you didn't attend last year and want to, let me know.</p><p>Finally, I have to say that I just stumbled on essembly.com today, and if you're interested in a decent politically-oriented online community, check it out.  I'm hooked - I've had some of the best political conversations in years on there (not a high bar to clear, you understand).</p><p>UPDATE: I changed the title to reflect my sincerely positive attitude towards my new job.  Inside jokes among amateur thinkers can be misinterpreted by others.</p>
