Happy New Year.  Bleh.  So what else is new?

Had a blast this past weekend in Philly.  Thursday at the very last <a href="http://discobiscuits.com">Disco Biscuits</a> concert I will ever attend, and New Years Eve at the <a href="http://www.brotherspast.com">BP</a> show that will definately NOT be my last.  That show was great.  You can download it <a href="http://www.archive.org/download/bp2004-12-31dpa4022.flac16/bp2004-12-31dpa4022.flac16_flac.zip">here</a>.  That band <a href="http://lotusvibes.com">Lotus</a> opened up for them and joined the band on stage for the countdown.  They played an instrumental version of "Eye of the Tiger".  Now, I hate just about everything about the 80s except the cars and the toys.  But that shit was hot, yo.  Plus, two nights of hotel partying with my kidz:

Nothing like rolling into a swank restaurant in a suit, tennis shoes, and a baseball cap.  Bling, bitch.

So what's on the menu for 6D in the oh five?  Well, I'm continuing to work on my <a href="http://socialmemorycomplex.6thdensity.net">tunes</a>.  I'm gonna try to see a bunch of shows.  I'm gonna hang with my boys more.  And I'm gonna try to work out and meditate - at the same time.

So did everybody have a good NYE?
