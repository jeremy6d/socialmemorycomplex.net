title: Easy Mit'in Shiro
tags: ethiopian, cooking, recipe

Tonight I advanced another step in my ethiopian cooking odyssey by finally pulling off one of my favorites: shiro wat. The big problem has always been the key ingredient: mit'in shiro, a staple powder made from roasted chickpeas, fava beans, peas, and other legumes, mixed with berbere. I ordered some from [this place](http://ethiopianspices.com), but I didn't want to wait, so I modified a recipe I'd found and just used chickpea flour. It turned out so well that I wanted to share it with anybody else who'd find it interesting.

### Easy Mit'in Shiro ###

Believe me, this is easier than how you really make it.

Mix together the following:

* 1/8 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/8 tsp ground cloves
* 1/4 tsp ground allspice
* 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground tumeric
* 1/2 tsp ground cumin
* 1/2 tsp ground black pepper
* 3/4 tsp dried basil or cilantro
* 1 tbsp salt
* 1 1/4 tsp ground coriander
* 1 1/2 tsp ground cardamom
* 1 3/4 tsp ground fenugreek seed (important)
* 2 1/2 tsp ginger
* 2 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tbsp red pepper flakes
* 2 tbsp ground red pepper
* 2 tbsp paprika
* 6 tbsp onion flakes
* 1 cup garbanzo bean flour (check your local health food store)

Use that to make this:

### Shiro Wat ###

* 1 1/2 cups mit'in shiro (the above should be enough)
* 2 cups water
* 1 cup chopped red onion
* 1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
* 3 cloves of garlic, chopped

Directions:

1.	Fry the onion and garlic in the oil until brown
2.	Add the water and boil
3.	Sprinkle in the mit'in shiro a little at a time, stirring to prevent lumps, until desired consistency is achieved. I like a firmer consistency, but I've seen it served very liquid, more like a stew.

Serve with injera (try [this recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/authentic-injera-aka-ethiopian-flat-bread-96980), but be easy on yourself - it's tough to pull off). Also, [gomen wat](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/gomen-wat/Detail.aspx) goes great with it!
