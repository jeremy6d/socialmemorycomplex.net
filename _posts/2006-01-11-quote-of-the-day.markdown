Kevin Carson <a href="http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/01/me-too-or-why-loyal-opposition-is-long.html">writes</a>:
<blockquote>I'm really sick of the "left" wing of the neoliberal corporate establishment giving us a slightly kindler and gentler version of the same imperialism and police statism. As Chomsky wrote somewhere else, there was probably a "liberal" wing of the Nazi Party that only wanted to kill half the Jews.</blockquote>
Exactly.
