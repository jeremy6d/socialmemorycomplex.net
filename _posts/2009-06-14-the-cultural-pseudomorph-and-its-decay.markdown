title: The Cultural Pseudomorph and Its Decay
excerpt: "Kevin Carson looks at lean manufacturing from a Mumfordian perspective at the Peer2Peer Foundation blog: &quot;The true potential of lean manufacturing is to eliminate inventory altogether by gearing production to demand. It doesn\x92t matter how lean a factory is internally, if the inventory is just swept under the rug\x96or into the factories and trucks, rather\x96with a thousand-mile distribution chain. True lean production will only be achieved in a completely relocalized economy, in which the machinery is not only scaled to production flow within the factory, but the factory itself is scaled as closely as possible to local demand and sited as close as possible to the point of consumption.&quot;"

Kevin Carson looks at lean manufacturing from a Mumfordian perspective at the Peer2Peer Foundation blog: &quot;The true potential of lean manufacturing is to eliminate inventory altogether by gearing production to demand. It doesn't matter how lean a factory is internally, if the inventory is just swept under the rug -- or into the factories and trucks, rather -- with a thousand-mile distribution chain. True lean production will only be achieved in a completely relocalized economy, in which the machinery is not only scaled to production flow within the factory, but the factory itself is scaled as closely as possible to local demand and sited as close as possible to the point of consumption.&quot;
