I've installed <a href="http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/">Tracks</a>, a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web application that implements the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142000280/qid=1143370534/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-9587420-9758203?s=books&v=glance&n=283155">Get Things Done</a> time management methodology, on one of my web servers.  If you're interested in checking it out, leave a comment here and I'll give you a URL.  No support guarantees* but it appears pretty stable.  I like the app and I'm already using it to keep track of personal projects and things I'm always forgetting to do.

* <em>One thing to keep in mind is my friend <a href="http://ryandaigle.com">Ryan</a> runs a <a href="http://docs.gtdtracks.com">Tracks service</a>.  The price is a steal and you get an expertly maintained system.  You can even import all your data from my site to his if mine flakes too much (I'm hosting on DreamHost presently, and they're really starting to piss me off).  </em>
