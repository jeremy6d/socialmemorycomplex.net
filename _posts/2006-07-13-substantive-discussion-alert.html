<p>Sam, a knowledgable and obviously adept Austrian economist, and I compare and contrast mutualism and the Austrian school on some key points in <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=466#comments">a recent posts' comment thread</a>.  We discuss the Labor Theory of Value vs. the subjectivists in the context of <a href="http://mutualist.blogspot.com">Kevin Carson</a>'s <a href="http://mutualist.org/id47.html">seminal work</a> on mutualist political economy.  And <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=466#comment-12904">Kevin shows up</a> to comment on our discussion!  Good reading if you're wondering why I'm so ga-ga over <a href="http://mutualist.org">mutualism</a>.</p>
