WTF, now I'm agreeing with <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041109-120712-7714r.htm">James Carville</a>?<blockquote>One possibility, he said, was to embrace a reform-oriented, anti-Washington agenda. That would require the ability of members of Congress to reject pork projects for their districts and stake the party's fortunes on fiscal discipline.</blockquote>Put that in your pipe and smoke it, <a href="http://www.acidlogic.com/weblogs/blogger.htm">Wil</a>.  Apparently, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/greenlantern113/109967372268853029#57739">the Democrats <b>are</b> reading my blog</a>.
