<p><a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20050901/D8CBNMA88.html">Ron Fournier</a> makes plain what "went wrong" - and it is the classic argument this blog makes day in, day out (well, except for weekends... and made up holidays... and when I fall and can't get up): <b>politicians cannot be trusted</b>.<blockquote>There's plenty of blame to go around - the White House, Congress, federal agencies, local governments, police and even residents of the Gulf Coast who refused orders to evacuate. But all the finger-pointing misses the point: <b>Politicians and the people they lead too often ignore danger signs until a crisis hits</b>.

It wasn't a secret that levees built to keep New Orleans from flooding could not withstand a major hurricane, but government leaders never found the money to fully shore up the network of earthen, steel and concrete barriers.

Both the Bush and Clinton administrations proposed budgets that low-balled the needs. Local politicians grabbed whatever money they could and declared victory. And the public didn't exactly demand tax increases to pay for flood-control and hurricane-protection projects.

Just last year, the Army Corps of Engineers sought $105 million for hurricane and flood programs in New Orleans. The White House slashed the request to about $40 million. Congress finally approved $42.2 million, less than half of the agency's request.

Yet the lawmakers and Bush agreed to a $286.4 billion pork-laden highway bill that included more than 6,000 pet projects for lawmakers. Congress spent money on dust control for Arkansas roads, a warehouse on the Erie Canal and a $231 million bridge to a small, uninhabited Alaskan island.</blockquote>I hope we learn.  I bet we don't.</p>
