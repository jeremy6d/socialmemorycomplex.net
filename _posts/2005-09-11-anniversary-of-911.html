<p>Take a moment to think about the victims.  Take a moment to think about the world we live in.  Take a moment to think about how those two are connected.</p><p>Take a moment to stop thinking about how you think the world should be, and instead look at the world as it <b>is</b>.  We serve a purpose much higher than politics when we do so.  Eschew for just this one day the pettiness of defining the tragedy in terms of <b>your</b> beliefs (not that there isn't a place for that, but not today, please).</p>
