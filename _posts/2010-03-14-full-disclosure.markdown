You can inspect the software that generates this blog on [Github](http://github.com/jeremy6d/jekyll). I borrowed heavily from [one developer](http://github.com/henrik/jekyll) to integrate Haml with pagination into [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It took a while (like all night) but it works. Tests are failing all over the place, though, so fork with caution.
