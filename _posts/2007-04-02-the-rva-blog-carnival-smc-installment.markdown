Since moving to Richmond almost <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=85">two years ago</a> I've really neglected to reach out to the Richmond blogging community as I had always intended.  <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=551">A recent Richmond event</a> awakened me to <a href="http://rvablogs.com">the larger network of RVA bloggers</a> and I started reading some of the local blogs.  There's great writing talent in this area and I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog_Carnival">blog carnival</a> idea suits this community very well.  So I'm happy to host this installment of the RVA Blog Carnival; sans theme, though I'll probably find or impose one on it anyway.

PJPink happened upon a wonderful Richmond eatery called Relish and <a href="http://rivercityfoodwine.blogspot.com/2007/03/relishing-lunch.html">documented it</a> on the <a href="http://rivercityfoodwine.blogspot.com/">River City Food and Wine</a> blog.  Great job, and there are more reviews where that came from.  Also in the reviews category, longtime RVA blogger <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt Walters</a> gives U-Haul <a href="http://mattwalters.net/2007/03/27/u-haul-has-awful-customer-service/">a piece of his mind</a> on their screw-up with his online order.  He even shares the letter he wrote to their corporate headquarters! A shocking expose.

The creativity of Richmond is well represented in the RVA blog community.  First off, <a href="http://www.lestercat.net/blog/">je ne se pais</a> shows off <a href="http://www.lestercat.net/blog/archives/2007/04/old_richmond_gr.php">a great photography find he made</a>: photos of old Richmond grocery stores. The <a href="http://westofshockoe.blogspot.com/2007/04/slowly-crawling-out-of-my-blog-hiatus.html">photography fun continues</a> with Phriendly Jaime's return from a blogging hiatus at <a href="http://westofshockoe.blogspot.com/">West of Shockoe</a>.  And the <a href="http://richmondcraftmafia.com">Richmond Craft Mafia</a>, a local group of crafters who maintain the <a href="http://rcm-offtherecord.blogspot.com">Off the Record</a> blog to keep their fans informed, whipped up <a href="http://rcm-offtherecord.blogspot.com/2007/03/vendor-spotlight.html">a vendor spotlight photo presentation of jewelry</a> from <a href="http://www.mypreciousstudio.com/index.html">My Precious Studio</a> in anticipation of their <a href="http://rcm-offtherecord.blogspot.com/2007/02/spring-bada-bing-is-back.html">upcoming show</a>.  <a href="http://tashmckelvey.com">My wife</a> is also a member and will be participating, but she's currently documenting <a href="http://potterybytasha.blogspot.com/2007/04/kiln-building.html">the construction of a new kiln</a> at her studio on <a href="http://potterybytasha.blogspot.com/">her blog</a>.

There's also a fair amount of activity on the subject of blogging itself lately. <a href="http://shamblingdarkness.blogspot.com/">The Shambling Darkness Project</a> announces <a href="http://shamblingdarkness.blogspot.com/2007/04/second-rvablog-congress-to-convene.html">the Second Rvablog Congress,</a> the location of which seems a little curious. Also, <a href="http://jsnotes.blogspot.com/">j's notes</a> addresses the issue of whether or not there's a need for <a href="http://jsnotes.blogspot.com/2007/03/code-of-conduct.html">a blogging code of conduct</a> with particular emphasis on the Virginia blogging community. Tasteful blogging also seems to be the issue over at <a href="http://krehbiel.blogspot.com/">The Krehbiel Strikes Back</a>, where Thomas Krehbiel <a href="http://krehbiel.blogspot.com/2007/03/counter-protesters-gone-wild.html">laments</a> another Virginia blogger's tacit support of violent intimidation tactics used by counter-protestors at the recent antiwar demonstration in D.C. (<a href="http://www.timesdispatch.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=RTD/MGArticle/RTD_BasicArticle&c=MGArticle&cid=1173350266836">mainstream</a> and <a href="http://richmond.indymedia.org/newswire/display/12773/index.php">alternative</a> local reporting).

I guess this moves us into political territory, so I'll go first: I actually <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=659">tackled the counter-protester issue</a> from another perspective <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net">here at SMC</a>.  My reaction to the protest was a driving motivation behind my <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org/2007/3/21/Announcing">announcement</a> of the <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org">Richmond Left Libertarian Alliance</a> and <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/171280/">a first meeting</a>, which hopefully will facilitate dialogue and cooperation between left-leaning activists and libertarians on the issues they agree on. Local libertarian blogger Robert Russo <a href="http://www.richmondliberty.org/mt/2007/04/the_left_libertarian_alliance.php">critically examines the Alliance</a> on the <a href="http://richmondliberty.org">RichmondLiberty.org</a> blog. While he agrees with me on the latent opportunities to forge ties with allies on the Left, he doesn't think our group's emergence signifies a split within the libertarian movement.

But I haven't addressed as many local issues yet, mostly because the existing bloggers do such a great job publicizing community stories in Richmond.  Don at <a href="http://saverichmond.com">Save Richmond</a> exposes a new development in the ongoing saga of the $65 million arts center, and there's really too much information reported there to summarize here - <a href="http://saverichmond.com/?p=368">check it out</a>!  Steven Retherford at <a href="http://hoosierinva.blogspot.com/">Sisyphus</a> tackles the issue of <a href="http://hoosierinva.blogspot.com/2007/03/community-organizing-and-revitalization.html">community organizing</a> which is a topic of keen interest to me.  Finally, <a href="http://slantblog.blogspot.com/">SLANTblog</a>'s F. T. Rae <a href="http://slantblog.blogspot.com/2007/04/slant-to-return.html">announces the return of SLANT magazine</a>, which examined Fan District life and now will once again!  Congratulations!

One last Richmond nugget for all local geeks: the Central Virginia Ruby Enthusiasts Group maintains a blog at <a href="http://cvreg.org">their site</a>, and <a href="http://cvreg.org/2007/3/25/april-meeting-announcement">they're having their monthly meeting</a> on Tuesday, April 10.  If you're interested in diving into <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">the Ruby language</a>, this meeting is a codejam so come on out!

Well, that's it for this edition of the RVA Blog Carnival.  Hope mine wasn't too long (or self-promoting), but go easy on me - this is my first carnival contribution.  I had about 1000% more fun than I expected writing it, though, and I hope to see some of you at the meeting Saturday! Ross over at <a href="http://haduken.com/">Haduken</a> will be hosting next week's RVA Blog Carnival installment.
