<img alt="Children of Men" id="image604" style="margin: 5px; float: left" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/childrenofmen.jpg' />Just saw <a href="http://www.childrenofmen.net/">this movie</a> with <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">Jim</a>, and I find I don't have the words for it.  Easily the scariest and most compelling movie I've ever seen, and very well done.  It's like getting hit by a car, but the authenticity of this vision of the future cannot be denied.  Go see it, but be ready to have the emotional shit kicked out of you.

<u>UPDATE:</u> How could I have neglected to mention <a href="http://wconger.blogspot.com/2007/01/lessons-of-children-of-men.html">Wally Conger's review</a> - that one that prompted me to see the movie? While I may not have the words, Wally has some great ones.
