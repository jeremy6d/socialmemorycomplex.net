If you still choose to conflate the two, even after the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/09/17/2367497.htm">events</a> of <a href="http://www.ajc.com/business/content/business/stories/2008/09/14/fannie_freddie.html">this</a> past <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080314_993131.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily">year</a>, you're simply dishonest.</p><p>Maybe this will make it easier for you to understand:<ul><li>A <em>free market</em> is where people compete or cooperate without resorting to force or fraud.</li><li><em>Capitalism</em> is <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/grigg/grigg-w36.html">what is happening right now</a>.</li></ul>Any questions?</p>
