Do <a href="http://www2.wcoil.com/~lpd/swat/swat.htm">these fellas</a> look like the good guys or the bad guys?  And, holy hell, do they look like <em>public servants</em> to you?</p><p>You may be concerned about judging by appearances, but sometimes there's a reason it <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/01/06/lima-ohio-drug-raid-gone-bad/">looks</a> and <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/01/11/lima-pd-pulls-animated-swat-image/">quacks</a> like a duck.</p>
