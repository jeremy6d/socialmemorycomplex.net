Good to see that there are some at my <a href="http://umw.edu">alma mater</a> who care about peace and justice.  From the <a href="http://fredericksburg.com/News/FLS/2006/102006/10062006/227306">fredericksburg.com story</a> on <a href="http://www.studentsforademocraticsociety.org/umw/main.html">UMW SDS</a>:
<blockquote>The group of University of Mary Washington students had taped sheets of paper to the side of the fountain outside Monroe Hall. The names of 300 American soldiers--just over 10 percent of U.S. military casualties of the war in Iraq--fluttered in the autumn wind. A ring of death.

It was one of many statements made by members of Students for a Democratic Society and the Anarchist Social Theory Club--two UMW organization that hosted an anti-war protest yesterday afternoon as part of a nationwide day of protest organized by anti-war group The World Can't Wait.</blockquote>
The next paragraph reminded me what a preppie-infested, oblivious dump my school is:
<blockquote>The UMW event drew fewer than 25 students on a campus with more than 4,000. Dozens of students were at "Rocktoberfest" instead, a music and barbecue party going on at the same time.</blockquote>
Still, I'm glad that there are students from my old school who are speaking out about the war.
