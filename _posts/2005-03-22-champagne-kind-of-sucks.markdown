You know, I like to be sophisticated.  I like to be cultured.  Within the past year (actually more like since I returned from Paris) I started drinking red wine pretty regularly.  But I gotta say, I do not like champagne.  At all.<br /><br />I bought a $40 bottle for new years that we never drank.  So the other night we popped it and had some with our movie.  And ya know what?  I used to drink that shit all the time in Germany, only there they called it "sekt".  [insert lame joke about how "sekt" sounds like "sucked"]  Tasha ended up drinking most of it, and I started kicking myself for not just going ahead and splurging on a nice Bordeux 2000 (we have on bottle left from Paris that we're saving for a special occasion, in other words, as long as we can hold out).  Or a case of Ayinger Altbairische Dunkelbier, the greatest beer in the world.<br /><br />So I admit it.  I have no class.  I don't like white sparkling wine.  It gives me indigestion and it tastes bad.<br /><br />Ahem.
