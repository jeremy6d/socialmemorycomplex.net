I've been having a lot of trouble composing posts with the WYSIWYG editor in <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>.  This appears to be <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2005/12/wp2/">a known problem</a>.  Hopefully this release will <a href="http://wordpress.org/development/2006/01/201-release/">fix</a> that.

UPDATE: The WYSIWYG editor is not fixed.  It's killing me when I'm doing nested lists.  Please do something about this, WordPress.org.
