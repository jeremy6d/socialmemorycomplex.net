I hear this guy is kind of an asshole, but even assholes can be right, as evidenced in this outtake from his <a href="http://www.fff.org/comment/com0408e.asp">article</a> published today:<blockquote>Every day, more and more Iraqi people are being killed or maimed in order to support the new Iraqi dictatorship of Iyad Allawi. When those victims or their survivors or their friends or relatives end up retaliating against the United States with terrorist acts, will the feds not immediately treat us to “They attacked us for our freedom and values”? But just as was the case in the 1993 and 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center, the claim will be false: The real reason for the new attacks will be the U.S. government's meddling in the internal affairs of other nations, including its support of brutal dictators who do its bidding.</blockquote>True dat.
