<p>Via <a href="http://www.techliberation.com/archives/042358.php">TLF</a> comes this great quote at <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000855.html">Coding Horror</a>:<blockquote><p>It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would ever consent to write a DestroyBaghdad procedure. Basic professional ethics would instead require him to write a DestroyCity procedure, to which Baghdad could be given as a parameter.</p></blockquote><p>Heh, yeah, that definitely takes me back to my days working for the military industrial complex.</p>
