<blockquote>Genuine libertarianism is very much left wing. It's revolutionary. The long and tragic alliance of libertarians with the right against the spectre of state socialism is coming to a close, as it served no purpose after the fall of the Soviet Union and so-called "conservatives" have subsequently taken to letting their true big-government-on-steroids colors fly.</blockquote>
While I would agree with this, I think when the term "left" is used we should be clear about what we mean, since leftism is so frequently associated with state socialism. I'm 100% for reclaiming the revolution, but we need to help redefine it, too. And in his post Brad basically sets out how to do this: leadership. Left libertarianism needs to <strong>be</strong> the left once more.
