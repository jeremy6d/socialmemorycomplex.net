Last month I attended [Wordcamp Richmond](http://wordcamprichmond.org) and saw a great presentation by [Christopher Gatewood](http://twitter.com/gatewood5000) entitled [The Seven Business Pitfalls for Wordpress and Web Professionals](http://wordcamprichmond.org/conferences/wordcamp-rva-2010/#Gatewood). The talk was informative enough that I took copious notes, and I'm publishing them in the hopes that others will benefit. I've since gotten Chris to help me draft some agreements and can tell you he's a great resource for this kind of stuff.

### The Seven Pitfalls ###
1. Half + Half = Half
	* Getting half of the money up front doesn't track with the work
	* Always get money up front
	* Progress payments that track with feature deliveries
2. Scope Creep
	* Bullet point list of scope
	* Define client and dev responsibilities
		* If you don't know what's IN scope, you don't know what's OUT of scope 
	* No silent accommodations
		* Don't let out of scope work creep in without speaking up
		* Even if you don't charge, let them know it's out of scope
		* "Agreement or approval in writing, for which email will suffice"
		* Inaccurate contracts or agreements that don't reflect the way you work can be worse than nothing
3. Subcontractor Cash Squeeze
	* Decide when payment takes place up front
	* Place this decision in agreement
	* Helps to decide not just timing but whether the payment occurs _at all_
4. Stay in range
	* Incremental approvals
	* Wait for an email
	* Who has authority to sign off? Get 1 or 2 people whom you can copy on all communications.
	* Due dates suck, make sure _delays are not your problem_
	* Iterative dates stemming from previous iterations to prevent hard-coded calendar dates
5. No free launch
	* Control and Rights
		* don't charge for delivery
		* make iterative releases to staging that YOU control
		* hosting not transferred to them until final payment
		* IP does not transfer until final payment (DMCA)
			* Your work includes a licensing component, be clear about it
			* Client doesn't "own" it until you're paid
	* After delivery, are you a priority?
		* Late fees
		* Interest charges
		* Attorney fees
		* Costs of collection
		* You can always use the carrot of waiving the fees
6. Work in Progress
	* It's expensive
	* Invoice the silence
		* claim the right to invoice without getting communication
		* define the calculation of what would be owed
7. Failure to Flex
	* Give recalcitrant or hard-up client options
		* Shrink scope
		* Pay in stages over time
	* Always good to work with client when possible to deliver and get paid
	* Get more money on the front end for risky, small clients
	* You need to consider that you _may not get paid_ so try to limit exposure

###Other stuff###
* Building on GPL Platforms, what do I own IP in?
	* You can own IP in themes / software that sits on top
	* You're contributing to the platform if you get into the source
	* You don't give up rights to content
	* BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT CLIENT WILL OWN AND NOT OWN ON DELIVERY / PAYMENT
