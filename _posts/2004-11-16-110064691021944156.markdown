Looks like <a href="http://www.wcpo.com/news/2004/local/11/16/recount.html">a recount in Ohio is happening after all</a>:<blockquote>Libertarian Michael Badnarik and the Green Party's David Cobb said on Monday they raised more than $150,000 in four days, mostly in small contributions. 

Ohio law requires payment of $10 per precinct for a recount, or $113,600 statewide. 

Badnarik and Cobb said they aren't trying to overturn President Bush's 136,000-vote victory in Ohio, but just want to ensure that all votes were counted properly in the face of concerns about Election Day irregularities. 

"Our bottom line is to stand up for the integrity of the voting process because the voting process is the heart of the democratic process," said Blair Bobier, spokesman for Cobb.</blockquote>Kerry and every single member of the Democratic Party should be ashamed of themselves.  I guess <b>this</b> is why we have third parties - so that <b>somebody</b> makes sure our republic works, even if they have to shoulder an unfair financial burden to do it.  I hope America realizes how much $113,600 hurts the Libertarian and Green parties.
