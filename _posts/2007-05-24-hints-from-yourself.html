<p>Compare <a href="http://xkcd.com/c267.html">this</a>:</p><p align=center><img id="image722" src="http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/choices_part_4.jpg" alt="choices_part_4.jpg" /></p><p>with <a href="http://lawofone.info/results.php?session_id=70#10">this</a>:<blockquote><p><i>Am I correct in assuming that all of the mind/body/spirit complexes that exist below levels of mid-sixth-density have a Higher Self at the level of mid-sixth-density? Is this correct?</i></p><p>...This is correct.</p><p><i>Would an analogy for this situation be that an individual's Higher Self is manipulating, to some extent shall I say, the mind/body/spirit complex that is its analog to move it through the lower densities for the purposes of gaining experience and finally transferring that experience or amalgamating it in mid-sixth-density with the Higher Self?</i></p><p>...This is incorrect. The Higher Self does not manipulate its past selves. It protects when possible and guides when asked, but the force of free will is paramount. The seeming contradictions of determinism and free will melt when it is accepted that there is such a thing as true simultaneity. The Higher Self is the end result of all the development experienced by the mind/body/spirit complex to that point.</p><p><i>Then what we are looking at is a long path of experience through the densities up to mid-sixth-density which is a function totally of free will and results in the awareness of the Higher Self in mid-sixth-density, but since time is illusory and there is a, shall I say, unification of time and space or an eradication of what we think of as time, then, all of this experience that results in the Higher Self, the cause of evolution through the densities, is existing while the evolution takes place. It is all simultaneous. Is this correct?</i></p><p>...We refrain from speaking of correctness due to our understanding of the immense difficulty of absorbing the concepts of metaphysical existence. In time/space, which is precisely as much of your self as is space/time, all times are simultaneous just as, in your geography, your cities and villages are all functioning, bustling, and alive with entities going about their business at once. So it is in time/space with the self.</p></blockquote>Forgive any confusion, but I just saw a great correlation between that comic and that passage in the <a href="http://lawofone.info">Law of One</a>. The idea that time and space are canvases we paint upon, not limitations on our identity, suggests that they can be transcended if we are sufficiently open-minded, perceptive, and even <em>playful</em>.  I plan to explore it more, as I'm starting to realize that my approach to philosophy, spirituality, and politics are all ultimately based on the same isomorphic principles.</p><p>To put it in an alternate sense, there is something singular about the individual, but I'm starting to think that the same dynamics that occur within each of us occur in the body politic, once that collective is properly defined.  We each deal with a multitude of forces within ourselves, and we always have to be skeptical of the concepts and values that seem to "rule" us, just as we do in society. The search for the authentic collective identity and the search for the authentic individual identity are not so dissimilar (but <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?page_id=390">I've argued that before</a>).</p>
