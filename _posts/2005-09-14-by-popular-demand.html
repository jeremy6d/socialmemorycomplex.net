<p>Well, actually by the demand of a few bitches...  but whatever, registration is no longer necessary to comment!  However, be advised that <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-register.php">registering</a> gives you a better experience.  That little cookie it puts on your system allows the sidebar elements to stay expanded or contracted, so you only get the info you want/need.</p><p>Share your thoughts now, before it's too late and I change my mind!</p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> Check out the sidebar: <a href="http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/dev/">Spam Karma</a> is tackling comment spam so you don't have to register to comment.  Isn't that sweet?</p><p>...pansies...</p><p><b>UPDATE:</b> Just added <a href="http://www.semiologic.com/projects/recent-comments/">Fuzzy Recent Comments</a> so I can keep track of you animals.</p>
