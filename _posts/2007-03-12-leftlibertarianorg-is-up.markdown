<a href="http://leftlibertarian.org/">leftlibertarian.org</a> is an aggregator for left libertarian blogs.  I pulled contributor feeds off the top of my head, so any exclusions are totally unintentional.  Just let me know if you'd like to be a contributor: I can give you a login so you can write exclusives for leftlibertarian.org, or I can syndicate your feed.

If you have a feed for a specific category that is more relevant, let me know as well!  You may even want to create a custom tag or category leftlibertarian.org can subscribe to.  Thanks to left libertarian <a href="http://radgeek.com">Rad Geek</a> for his excellent <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress">FeedWordPress plugin</a>.

Also, if you have any ideas on how to make this site better or more useful to left libertarians, holla.  I may change this over to a <a href="http://mephistoblog.com">Mephisto</a> installation at some point.  I could also install a forum if people think that would be useful.  Long term, I may try to use my custom <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=484">ThreadSpinner</a> web application with it, but I promise I won't squash any content you create!

As always: my first name at sixth density dot net.
