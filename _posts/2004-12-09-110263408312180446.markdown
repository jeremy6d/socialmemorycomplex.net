From the Christian Science Monitor, <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1129/dailyUpdate.html">a new report</a> by the <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dsb/">Defense Science Board</a> - a Pentagon advisory committee - sharply constrasts the message of the Neocons:<blockquote><b>Muslims do not hate our freedom, but rather they hate our policies</b> [the report says]. The overwhelming majority voice their objections to what they see as one-sided support in favor of Israel and against Palestinian rights, and the long-standing, even increasing, support for what Muslims collectively see as tyrannies, most notably Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Pakistan and the Gulf states. Thus, when American public diplomacy talks about bringing democracy to Islamic societies, this is seen as no more than self-serving hypocrisy.</blockquote>This <b>matters</b>.  It is not incidental, and it is not mutually exclusive with condemning the horrors of terrorism.  But it <b>does matter</b>.

How much clearer can the DSB say it?  <b>Hold your politicians accountable, America!!!</b>
