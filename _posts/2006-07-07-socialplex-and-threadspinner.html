<p>I've had the socialplex.com domain for some time and hadn't done anything with it, so <a href="http://socialplex.com">I've set up a forum there</a>.  Please feel free to stop by and chat if you want to.  This space is for all my "internet friends" who want a neutral space to hang out and discuss stuff.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the problems I've had for a while with my writing on others' blogs being lost to me (yes, cut and paste is too hard) I am working on a web application that will sort of combine forums and blogs.  I'm currently calling it "ThreadSpinner".  While I don't want to get into too much detail, the idea is to create a community oriented site that allows people to easily converse and, simultaneously, "spin off" their conversations into original writing.  I will be writing it in <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a>, and if anybody's interested in collaborating I'm setting up a Subversion repository.</p>
