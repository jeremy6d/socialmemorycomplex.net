[Chris George fucking hits this one out of the park.](http://newkindofmind.blogspot.com/2010/09/why-im-not-anti-racist.html) In a short blog post, he makes the point I've been trying to make to many of my fellow left libertarians more succinctly and persuasively than I've ever been able. Excerpt:

>The language used by "anti-racists" can commonly come off as divisive and inflammatory rather than helpful and informative. And it doesn't appear to be a good strategy for most of the same reasons that referring to Statists as violent idiots doesn't appear to be a good strategy. In fact, this strategy would seem to turn into enemies the only people capable of helping racists out of their prejudice. People have flaws. The goal, as seems obvious to me, should be to help them overcome those flaws, not use them as something to bludgeon everyone over the head with. 

And the kicker that should speak to every person genuinely concerned with improving the human condition:

>In sum, it's not opposition to racism that I oppose. It's the tendency (often based on little or no evidence) to demonize people who may be racists -- especially when that demonization comes at the expense of the goal you are trying to accomplish -- that I oppose.

Another essay of his [arguing against the appeal to morality in advancing libertarianism](http://www.libertarianminds.com/moralizing-isn't-getting-libertarians-anywhere) is also great reading. I must say that it is extremely validating to see people take the problems of our society seriously enough to _get off their fucking high horse about it_. Given the past debate in the ALLiance over all this, it's nice to see somebody else articulate the case for open-mindedness over politically correct orthodoxy.
