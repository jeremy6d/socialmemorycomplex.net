Sorry, I know I went from blogging five times in one day to not blogging once in five days.  I haven't been too happy lately, and Saturday I spent all day helping <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt</a> move to his new crib.

So on Wednesday I left my phone at the office and went home to hang out with <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">Jim</a> until Tasha got home.  We had purchased some premium steaks to grill, but Jim had to leave before I could start.  Tasha was in class and usually got home no later than 9:30 PM, so I started cooking around quarter after and finished up around 10.

When Tasha still wasn't home, I got worried that she couldn't contact me (we don't have a phone for the house) so I drove back to work. When I got to work, I called Tasha and (of course) she had arrived home just in time to miss me.  And on the way home, my car overheated!  It had had a VERY slow leak for some time that I had always managed to control, but now the engine was hot for real.  So I pulled over and called Tasha, and she came out.  I called a tow truck but I got home as soon as the car cooled down.

So since Thursday it's been at the mechanic, and they keep telling me it's either the head gasket or something else.  Now, this car has just under 200,000 miles on it, so if it was the engine I wouldn't be surprised, but they keep saying they doubt it's the head gasket.  I've replaced some housing for the coolant and a thermostat, but each time the car keeps overheating.  So now they want to check the water pump, but I'm about to give up unless something they do starts working.  $500 later and the problem's still there?  That's bullshit.

Anyway, so I may be shopping for a new car soon.  This is two months after paying the son of a bitch off.  The engine already has a problem with running way too rich that not even the dealer can fix (VW can suck it), so I'm not putting any more money in it if it's not the pump.  Just not a good investment.

I need something reliable and good on fuel.  Tasha wants me to get a station wagon so she has a replacement vehicle for her business.  Any suggestions?

In other news, it looks like <a href="http://tashamckelvey.com">Tasha</a> had a record year in sales!
