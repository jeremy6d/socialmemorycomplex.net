I've just realized how much of an impact <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wilforbis/weblogs/blogger.htm">Wil Forbis</a> could have on the upcoming election.

Now, just think about ALL the Democrat women voters that were thusly... umm... not had sex with by Clinton.  You begin to see why this taste issue is a big problem for the Democrats.  It's a matter of life or death!

If you're a regular MSCP reader, you know that a while back Forbis suggested developing a diet or a pill or something like that to make, well, Democrats have better tastes in their mouth (look, I'm a gentleman - I refer to oral sex by classy innuendo).  Unfortunately his archives for that time period are missing because he is bisexual, but I assure you that MSCP R&amp;D is developing such a flavorful remedy even as I write.  It's only now that you finally see why Wil is crucial to getting Kerry in the White House.  

And that was a minute you just wasted reading this post that you will never, ever get back.
