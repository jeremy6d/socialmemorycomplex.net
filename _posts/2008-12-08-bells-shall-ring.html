<p>Congratulations to <a href="http://dawnstitches.blogspot.com/2008/12/im-engaged.html">my sis-in-law Kristal</a> and <a href="http://jbusa.blogspot.com/2008/12/in-case-you-havent-heard.html">John</a> on their engagement!  They're great for each other and a hell of a lot of fun to have as relatives.</p><p>Tasha and I found out about it on <s>Friday</s> Saturday, which was also the date of a birthday celebration for John at Southside Plaza Bowl (I reviewed the establishment a few months ago <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=883">here</a>).  So it was good to celebrate two happy occasions, eat Kristal's awesome carrot cake she made for John, and rock some duckpin bowling.</p><p>While the upcoming year is going to be hectic (and a bit scary) for all, I can't help but feel encouraged when people make such a commitment to each other. Marriage is not easy, but if the unexamined life is not worth living, then marriage is a crash course in that examination and a concrete investment in a worthwhile life.  As I see it, anytime people resolve to share their lives with another they make this crazy planet a little more human.</p><p>I wish them much happiness as they lay the foundation for this next stage of their lives.</p>
