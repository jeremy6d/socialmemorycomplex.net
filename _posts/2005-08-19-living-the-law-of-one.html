<p>Yo, compadres.  I'm blogging from the <a href="http://www.lawof1.org/conference/index.html">Living the Law of One</a> Seminar at <a href="http://www.woodedglen.com/">Wooded Glen</a> in Henryville, IN.  It's sponsored by <a href="http://www.llresearch.org/main.htm">L/L Research</a> whose work I've studied and supported for about 5 years now.  I'm actually on the staff helping with the recording and facilitation of the seminar, so while I'm there, I might as well be doing some web documenting.  Pursuant to this lofty goal, I will be <i>liveblogging</i> some of the lectures to give my readership an idea of the depth and breadth of this seminar.  Isn't that teh hip?  The blogging will also serve as notes I can use to assemble a write-up about the seminar, and hey, if the liveblog entries suck I'll just condense them into one writeup.  Anyway, I should be available online most of the time with my bluetooth internet connection through my new cell phone, so holla yo.</p>
