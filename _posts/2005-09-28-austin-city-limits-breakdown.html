<p>My picks for best performances:<ol><li>Mates of State - these guys completely blew me away.  Two people made a bigger, fuller sound than a lot of the 5  person bands.  And the girl hit every high note and the guy playing drums and singing hit every harmony perfect.  It felt wierd to be that thrilled by what is essentially a pop act, but it literally moved me to tears how fucking tight and full sounding this group was.</li><li>Arcade Fire - obviously, this was the high point of everybody's festival experience.  The only performance where I was within 50 ' of the stage.  Wow.  All I can say is wow.  Absolutely amazing - it's nice to see angst done that gorgeously.  Chris Martin remarked during the Coldplay performance that when they saw the Arcade Fire that day they all resolved to get new jobs.</li><li>Wilco - now, I didn't think I would appreciate the performance that much, as I'm not familiar with a lot of their songs.  But I remember James posting something after seeing them about how they are one of the great American bands, and I'd have to agree.  Though the show started slow it really took off.  I was amused at how thoroughly I enjoyed what at first listen always seemed like such straight ahead music.</li><li>The Decemberists - I had heard these guys before but they were REALLY good.  About as eclectic as you can get, and while it wasn't neccessarily "rocking" music it was hard not to do a little polka dance when they were playing.</li><li>Keane - yeah, I said it.  I know they're poppy as hell, and they really take themselves far too seriously, but I enjoyed the show.</li><li>The Fiery Furnaces - liked it, would like to hear more.</li></ol></p><p>Was not impressed by Death Cab or Coldplay.  Spoon and Rilo Kiley were alright (I think if I had seen more of the latter I would have enjoyed it more, but it was 106 degrees and Tasha needed to cooldown).  Bloc Party was alright, too, I guess.  Tortoise was cool but didn't quite fit in.</p><p>It was really hot and expensive.  Was anybody else there?</p>
