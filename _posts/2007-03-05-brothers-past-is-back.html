Rick Lowenberg, the machine-like drummer who laid the foundation for the band's sound with his frenetic jungle breaks and house beats, left the band to pursue a law career.  At the time it was hard for us fans to see a future, even though the band immediately announced a new drummer: former <a href="http://www.omtrio.com/">OM Trio</a> drummer Ilya Stemkovsky.  More than most bands, BP was built on group dynamics, with interplay between the musicians playing an integral part in their performances.  Even among the faithful, there was severe doubt the band could survive this.

As theoretically perfect and technically competent a fit as Ilya was, the unique chemistry of BP - honed over six years of relentless touring and improvisatory electronica excursions - seemed likely to be stunted for the next year or so.  Indeed, many of my fears were confirmed during the two shows I attended on last year's fall tour.  Still in the middle of learning both the extensive BP repertoire and fitting his style in with the other three players', Ilya played well but had a hard time complementing the sound to which we fans have grown so attached.  I even knew people who swore off the group out of abject despair.

However, the awesome performance on Saturday night was undoubtedly the product of far more than simply low expectations.  It was clear to this amateur musician that Ilya and the band had worked hard to refine his style into something resembling the more minimalist beats of his predecessor, while still demonstrating amazing chops that Rick never had.  The cues were hit, the jams worked (Ilya <em>nailed</em> the four-to-the-floor riffs), old songs incorporated recomposed parts, and we even got three or four new songs.  As a veteran musician, Ilya obviously was able to figure out the energy of BP and saw where he was needed.  On Saturday he demonstrated more than just being a great replacement drummer for BP; he demonstrated a mastery of group performance and musical subtlety that confirms his legend.

I am overjoyed to witness the return of my friends and favorite band, <a href="http://brotherspast.com">Brothers Past</a>.  With this newfound energy I look forward to another six years of the greatest songwriting and dance grooves out there - all in one convenient and unified package.  Special kudos to Ilya for <em>getting it</em>.
