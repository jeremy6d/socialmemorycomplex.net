<P>In the inaugural post on a new blog, <a href="http://wrongthinkinggirl.com">Wrong Thinking Girl</a>, I attack conservativism's disregard for the full scope of the human experience through the prism of the death penalty debate:<blockquote><p>Here's the point: society will always have frontiers of fear and misunderstanding, and the deepest abyss of the human heart may always be unknowable. But extinguishing life doesn't remedy anything - it only continues the pointless violence. It does this, furthermore, by empowering the biggest killer by far in human history. Death is not a currency with which to pay back a debt, nor is it a mechanism for teaching a lesson. By promoting the death penalty, RTG is simply showing that matters of human interest are simply too complex to be dealt with in a thoughtful manner and must therefore be swept from the healthy mind. We'd do better to ponder our own weaknesses and savagery - especially with regards to the state - than to simply isolate cases where human nature has failed us and purge these symptoms of a deeper collective problem.</p></blockquote>Read more <a href="http://www.wrongthinkinggirl.com/2006/07/02/human-nature-the-fulcrum-of-political-polarity/">here</a>.</p>
