Damn, Bush really does suck.  I've never heard of this <a href="http://www.capitolhillblue.com">Capitol Hill Blue</a> website before, but even if the shit on there isn't true, I have no problem spreading rumors for a site who's motto is: "Because nobody's life, liberty, or property is safe while Congress is in session".  WORD.

Anyway, the articles in question.  First there's <a href="http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4629.shtml">this one</a> on some unnamed witnesses' testimony that Bush knew about the intentional leak of the identity of undercover CIA operative Valerie Plame.  Check this out:

<blockquote>Their damning testimony has prompted Bush to contact an outside lawyer for legal advice because evidence increasingly points to his involvement in the leak of covert CIA operative Valerie Plame's name to syndicated columnist Robert Novak.</blockquote>

You knew there was more to Bush getting an attorney than "routine procedure".  Second, there's <a href="http://www.capitolhillblue.com/artman/publish/article_4636.shtml">this article</a> about Bush being a nutcase.

<blockquote>In interviews with a number of White House staffers who were willing to talk off the record, a picture of an administration under siege has emerged, led by a man who declares his decisions to be “God's will” and then tells aides to “fuck over” anyone they consider to be an opponent of the administration.</blockquote>

That kinda explains the Plame leak, doesn't it?  It also explains Tenet's resignation:

<blockquote>"Tenet wanted to quit last year but the President got his back up and wouldn't hear of it," says an aide. "That would have been the opportune time to make a change, not in the middle of an election campaign but when the director challenged the President during the meeting Wednesday, the President cut him off by saying 'that's it George. I cannot abide disloyalty. I want your resignation and I want it now."

Tenet was allowed to resign "voluntarily" and Bush informed his shocked staff of the decision Thursday morning. One aide says the President actually described the decision as "God's will."</blockquote>

The article goes on to point out that Ashcroft and Bush are "tight" because they both believe "any action is justifiable in the name of God.”  Reading shit like this makes me almost think I <strong>should</strong> vote for Kerry - then I remember that at least the Bible thumpers are predictable.  It just looks more an more like Bush ain't gonna win.  Plus, since Republicans always take my home state, it doesn't matter whom I vote for anyway.
