I know what you're thinking.  "Great post there, Jeremy.  We were all really worried because we hadn't heard about your personal life and/or inconvenient health episodes.  But what about your political ranting?  Give us that hateful crack that you spew?!?!"  I know you're thinking this because I can read your mind.  Having read it, I must ask you: have your considered a ghost writer?  HA!

But amazingly witty jokes aside, I'm sorta taking a break from the soul crushing task of pointing out every little thing Bush does that is morally contemptuous.  The biggest story right now is Social Security reform, and while I don't agree 100% with his plan, I'm taking a wait and see approach on it.  If it puts us in a better net position than we're in currently, I won't hesitate to assign props in the appropriate manner.  And with everything else, things have been pretty boring.  I don't have anything deep to say about the tsunami, and everything else seems petty in comparison, so I'd just as soon stay petty for right now.  Deal.

And Wil, it may interest you to know that I found <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/blog.html">this X guy</a> <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/greenlantern113/110367131987839495/#69587">whom you worship</a>.  Turns out he's pretty cool.  Who would have thought a deity would have a blog?  Answer: me.
