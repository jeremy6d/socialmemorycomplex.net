Given the fact that no WMDs were found in Iraq: how can you, on the one hand, support the war in Iraq, and believe <a href="http://libertariangirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/bush-plugs-koran.html">this</a>:<blockquote>I don't see how the words of the Koran have anything to do with "self-government." The more devoutly Islamic the nation, the less self-government it seems to have. Only Turkey has democracy, and they practice a secular form of Islam there. And I don't trust the Islamist AKP party that's now in power there.</blockquote>So, we're NOT over there to create a democracy in the middle east?  So why are we there?

It's even a dumber argument on a pink background.
