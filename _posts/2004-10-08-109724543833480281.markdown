God my blogging is for shit.  I've been so busy with work, I haven't had time to say anything.  Any free time I've had has been helping Tasha out, getting my car fixed, or trying to convince people that "just pulling out" is both an acceptable way to solve the Iraq problem AND a valid birth control method.  I'm exhausted, I'm overworked, and I'm flying to Louisville, KY tomorrow with my internet buddy, Sabine, who's from the Netherlands.  We're going to visit my friends Gary, Carla, Jim, and Vara, who run <a href="http://www.llresearch.org">L/L Research</a>.  The next two weeks are gonna be crazy.

And just for L's benefit, the best libertarian plan I've heard to solve the social security dilemna is to cut back all gov't services and activities to only constitutional levels, sell off all gov't assets that would then no longer be needed, and use the money to buy private annuities for all people invested in social security.  BTW, L, I don't hold it against you for not knowing about Craig Kilborn.  He sucks anyway and is best forgotten.
