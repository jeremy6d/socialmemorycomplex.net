<p><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/plazabowl004-300x225.jpg' alt="plazabowl004" title="plazabowl004" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1308" />So Matt O., I, and our wives rolled over to <a href="http://www.myspace.com/plazabowlrva" title="Plaza Bowl and Duckpins, LLC">Plaza Bowl and Duckpins</a> this past Thursday to <a href="http://www.ndbc.org/">duckpin bowl</a> and drink PBR pitchers. We had a great time and ended up talking to the owner (it was a slow night). He asked us about any ideas we had for better marketing the place and we had a great conversation that really explored our love for the place. </p>  <p>Plaza Bowl is really just an incredibly fun destination - it's laid back, and you don't feel pressure to bowl 300. There's now a stage where some of the lanes used to be, and bands play regularly. It's got a great retro feel since none of the equipment has been manufactured for decades, and the owner maintains it himself.</p>  <p>In fact, we were thrilled that he invited us behind the scenes to observe the 1950s era machinery that runs the lanes, and I snapped some pictures on my iPhone. As programmers Matt and I were amazed at this complex mechanical state machine, and there's an aesthetic to the vintage gears, chains, and conveyor belts that adds to the appeal. A steampunk's dream!</p>  <p>I highly recommend that you check Plaza Bowl and Duckpins out. It's difficult to communicate how awesome this place is, but I guarantee you'll have a good time and be back. We want to keep this place in town, so show your love!</p>  <div style="text-align: center;"><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/plazabowl002-300x225.jpg' alt="plazabowl002" title="plazabowl002" width="300" height="225" style="margin: 30px;" /><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/plazabowl005-300x235.jpg' alt="plazabowl005" title="plazabowl005" width="300" height="235"  style="margin: 30px;"  /><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/plazabowl001-247x300.jpg' alt="plazabowl001" title="plazabowl001" width="247" height="300"  style="margin: 30px;" /><img src='http://blog.6thdensity.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/plazabowl003-181x300.jpg' alt="plazabowl003" title="plazabowl003" width="181" height="300"  style="margin: 30px;" /></div>
