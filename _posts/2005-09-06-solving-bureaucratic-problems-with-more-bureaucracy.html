<p>This dunce <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/na/D8CERD5G0.html">does not get it</a>:<blockquote> Buffeted by criticism over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush said Tuesday he will oversee an investigation into what went wrong and why _ in part to be sure the country could withstand more storms or attack.

Bush also announced he is sending Vice President Dick Cheney to the Gulf Coast region on Thursday to help determine whether the government is doing all that it can.</blockquote></p><p>Are you sure Dick is all <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2005/09/06/cheney/index.html">rested up</a> yet?  Maybe he needs another week to compose himself...</p><p><blockquote>"<b>Bureaucracy is not going to stand in the way of getting the job done for the people</b><b>," the president said after a meeting at the White House with his Cabinet on storm recovery efforts.</b></blockquote>What the fuck are you talking about?  Bureaucracy isn't some convenient scapegoat you can use at your leisure.  The reason bureaucracy tied things up is because the rescuers were leaderless.</p><p>YOU are the fucking problem, George W. Bush.  YOU are responsible for the gov't.  YOU did not show leadership when it was desperately needed.  YOU kept making snide remarks about how you weren't to blame and how much you sympathized with the people.  Now YOU want to investigate why your minions didn't do what, in hindsight, you think should have been done?</p><p>This is an insult to everybody's intelligence.  Get this moron out of the White House NOW.</p>
