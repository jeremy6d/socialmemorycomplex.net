<p>After a long hiatus, I'm pleased to announce that the <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org">Richmond Left Libertarian Alliance</a> is back!  See <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org/2008/5/25/swinging-back-into-gear"> the announcement</a> on the relaunched site.  Special thanks to Brady for not letting me drop this ball forever.  Also thanks to <a href="http://modrails.com">mod_rails</a>, the new Apache module that makes deploying Rails apps easier than ever.  I think the site will be a lot more stable now than it ever was before.</p>
