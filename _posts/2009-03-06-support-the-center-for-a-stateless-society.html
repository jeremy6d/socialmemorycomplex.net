<p>How many of you have cited work done by Kevin Carson in discussing left libertarianism with others?  Well, we all know Kevin has done some truly groundbreaking work on economics, organization theory, and much more.  The amazing thing is that he's done all this on his own dime in his spare moments.  Now think about how much more he and other rigorous anarchists and libertarians could do if they were <em>paid for their work!</em></p><p>You have the opportunity to do that now.  Go to the <a href="http://c4ss.org">Center for a Stateless Society</a> and <a href="http://c4ss.org/support-the-center">help out with their fundraising drive</a>.  The money goes directly to supporting research that we all can use to better make the case for market anarchism.</p>
