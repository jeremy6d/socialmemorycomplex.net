If you're looking for market solutions to environmental problems (a la my <a href="http://socialmemorycomplex.blogspot.com/2004/06/ok-libertarianism-and-environmentalism.html">libertarianism and environmentalism post</a>) you can now tune in to <a href="http://www.commonsblog.org/">The Commons Blog</a>.  I don't completely agree with the tone of some of the commentary (I think the nature of the corporation, as an institution, is part of the environmental problem) but it does have some great little articles on free market environmental issues.

And hey - it's a link that takes you away from here.  I know you're just looking for a fashionable way to exit.  I see you looking at the door.
