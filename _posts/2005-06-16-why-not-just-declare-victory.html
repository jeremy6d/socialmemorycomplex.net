<p>And then <a href="http://libertariansforamerica.blogs.com/index/2005/06/victory_in_iraq.html">get the hell out of there</a>, says Logan Ferree of <a href="http://libertariansforamerica.blogs.com">Democratic Freedom</a>:<blockquote>I think that many liberals who believe that Kerry had to cast a vote in favor of the war are confused.  They think that the American mainstream is jingoistic and imperialistic, so you've got to pretend to be a warrior.  I'll offer an alternative version of the average America.  While he's rather nationalistic, or should I use the more pc-term patriotic, he's also got a strong isolationist streak in him.  Making the world a better place sounds like nice, but it depends on the cost.  And it doesn't take much for the cost to be too high.  Which is why the Iraq War and the President's handling of the situation is so unpopular right now.

But defeat isn't an option, which is why the Democrats have been worried about calling for exit from Iraq.  They don't want to be the ones to admit defeat.

That's why we need to present this as a victory.  We've won, our job is done, let's bring the boys back home.</blockquote><p>I'm not sure I agree that it's a "victory", but I'd gladly accept (for the moment) whatever label Dems want to put on it if it gets our troops and country out of danger.</p>
