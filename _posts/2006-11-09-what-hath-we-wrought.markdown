So looks like the Democrats picked up some major street cred the other night.  Yay for them.

I'm still not entirely comfortable with the fact that I voted a straight Dem ticket, mostly because I feel I lack a sufficiently rigorous philosophical basis for doing so.  I feel that voting undercuts my spiritual separation from the State.  Also, while there's no doubt that rejecting Republicans was the moral way forward and that divided government is likely better than a one-party legislative and executive branch, Democrats still agree on far too much with them: corporatism, drug laws, substantive change in Iraq, police militarization, etc.  Their disagreements are either trivial or procedural.

So don't let down your guard yet.  I'm hopeful Dems will roll back some of the more egregious offenses of the Bush Admin, but I'm not holding my breath. Such a development would fly in the face of American political history.

We'll see.  In the meantime: <a href="http://mll.agorism.info">AGORA!  ANARCHY!  ACTION!</a>
