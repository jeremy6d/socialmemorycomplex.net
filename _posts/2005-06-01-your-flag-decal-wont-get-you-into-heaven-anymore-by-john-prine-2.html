<p><i>But your flag decal won't get you<br />
Into heaven anymore<br />
They're already overcrowded<br />
From your dirty little war<br />
Now Jesus don't like killin'<br />
No matter what the reasons for<br />
And your flag decal won't get you<br />
Into heaven anymore.<br /></i></p><p>From <a href="http://www.johnprine.net/">John Prine</a>'s self titled <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002I97/002-4186888-0704049?v=glance">album</a>.  We saw him last year - great show.  I can't believe the flag decal glut was going on during Vietnam - if anything, the song is more relevant nowadays.</p><p>Now he needs to write a song about those goddamn yellow ribbons... we GET IT.  You SUPPORT THE TROOPS.  Have another cookie.</p>
