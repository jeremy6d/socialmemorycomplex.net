Pema Chodron's [What to Do When the Going Gets Rough](http://www.lionsroar.com/pema-chodron-what-to-do-when-the-going-gets-rough/) has had a great deal of influence in my daily life.  It appears to me that in meeting the difficulties of life we are faced with several levels of experience.  In order to process this stuff we harvest from our waking lives, we need more than just the mind, and Chodron has given me novel tools to do just this.

I'm fascinated by the way Bhuddist thought aligns with my chosen philosophy of life and spirit, but the most intriguing aspect for me is the praxis of Bhuddism.  While much spiritual information can seem unmoored from and hovering over the material life, Bhuddism has a wealth of accumulated practices, strategies, techniques, and attitudes that seem to be able to ground the subtle and intangible in the daily go-round.  Chodron's article was the first that really woke me up to how much help there is available when we seem to be floating in mid-air.

The great lesson I feel I'm now learning is that of appreciating emotion.  I've often approached it in the past in much the same way an objectivist might: that our emotions are reflections of the quality of our thinking.  According to this attitude, a difficult emotion is a sign of some problem to be addressed, and the purpose of addressing it is to attain forward progress by overcoming or purging it.  It is no exaggeration to describe my regard for emotions as one regards noise in the signal.

It was Steven Tyman's [A Fool's Phenomenology: Archetypes of Spiritual Evolution](https://www.amazon.com/Fools-Phenomenology-Archetypes-Spiritual-Evolution/dp/0761833560) that really opened my eyes to another possibility.  Tyman is quite emphatic about the vital nature of the emotions, not as obstacles to be overcome or distortions to be vacated but as _sources of information_ that can communicate what we cannot rationally or intellectually apprehend.  In fact, emotions are not even something we properly generate; instead they blow in of their own seeming accord, and we are utterly subject to them.  To respect emotions, I suppose, is to grant them their own space in life.  

Two alternatives to acceptance occur to me: either (1) _repressing_ this energy by ignoring it, locking it down and using discipline and control to keep it at arms length, or (2) _expressing_ it in a kneejerk, reactive manner that so often seems to leave us worse off but at least lets the energy flow onward.  Both paths, turning emotion further inward and turning it further outward, seem to have as their end a desire for finality and resolution, to dislocate the emotion.  The urgency of emotion compels us to react in one of these two extreme manners, but what is it about emotion that makes it so urgent, so full of pressure and tension?

Chodron's article speaks directly to this: _our conceit that we can resolve emotion_ is the misapprehension (though making this error is itself a great teacher).  One can ignore any source of information, be it an announcement from outside, a flare of pain in our bodies, a letter we receive, etc.  What we gain by avoiding the emotional information is the chance to avoid the edginess, tension, and lack of solid footing that attend emotions.

However, Chodron tenderly points out that it is precisely this discomfort that teaches.  When we learn to sit with our feelings, not imprisoning or evicting them but simply accepting all of their nastiness and spikyness and sinking-ness, we find that it is here that true spiritual discipline comes into play.  For perhaps it is that emotions come at us from nowhere precisely because we have vast resources that waking consciousness cannot always seat.  We find, in other words, that we cannot think these problems; we must rely upon other resources that are no less us, no less helpful.

And then there is the point about recognizing others' emotional reactions and seeing a mirror for the lessons we're grappling with.

> Recognize that, just like us, millions are burning with the fire of aggression. We can sit with the intensity of the anger and let its energy humble us and make us more compassionate.

If nothing else, Chodron convinced me our helplessness in the face of emotion is a reason to be more patient not just with ourselves but with others.  None of us come out of the "fire of aggression" unsinged; allowing others to work through emotion at their level provides us valuable experience and feedback, since it's hard to see somebody emote without emoting along with them to some degree.  Indeed, I think emotion has often confounded me precisely because of its contagious nature.  But we're not "catching" something from another really; all that's happening is that we're being reminded of our own emotional issues, and if one is apt to ignore them within, then the reflection from without is most angering.

So what we're really playing with here is the directionality of our attention, moving it away from escape from emotion and towards diving headfirst into emotion.  Others' unhinged emotions would not bother us if we were ourselves balanced.  But when we lie to ourselves about our affective health, it can be absolutely flooring when we discover how easily our buttons are pushed.  This is not a failing, though; it is once again merely information that we can use to understand ourselves better.  In that way, we receive a true gift from others "freaking out", reminding us how compassion, understanding, and patience are genuine silver bullets (if slow moving projectiles) in these situations.

This was a big wake-up call for yours truly, even as I acknowledge many probably find this insight abjectly trivial.  So often I have approached emotion in the human condition as some mistake to be corrected.  That emotion could simply constitute a way of wrestling with realities, in the same way I wrestle with ideas in the mind, floored me.  Additionally, Chodron described that indeterminate, uncomfortable feeling so well that it was easy to recognize and make the connection in my own life.

> Right at the point when we are about to blow our top or withdraw into oblivion, we can remember this: we are warriors-in-training being taught how to sit with edginess and discomfort. We are being challenged to remain and to relax where we are.

This advice finally strikes me as very similar to the [balancing exercises discussed in the Law of One material](http://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=5#2), where instead of trying to overcome feelings we actually intensify them to the extreme, but then intensify to the extreme the opposite emotion.  

> To begin to master the concept of mental discipline it is necessary to examine the self. The polarity of your dimension must be internalized. Where you find patience within your mind you must consciously find the corresponding impatience and vice versa. Each thought that a being has, has in its turn an antithesis. The disciplines of the mind involve, first of all, identifying both those things of which you approve and those things of which you disapprove within yourself, and then balancing each and every positive and negative charge with its equal. The mind contains all things. Therefore, you must discover this completeness within yourself.

The goal is to have a balance of emotion in our lives, not an absence of emotion.  To understand the full spectrum of affect is to familiarize oneself with the potentials out there that will meet us as we serve more and more purely and thoroughly.  As those of Ra say, it's really about self-acceptance so that all of our qualities are known and therefore not subject to any kind of exploitation or ignorant mistake.

It is a really weird sensation, I must say, to feel a negative emotion and to let it simply occur to oneself, not trying to avoid it in some way or dislodge it through lashing out at phenomenal reality.  I continue practicing this discipline poorly.  But just knowing that there is a mode in which undesired emotions can benefit me, one in which I can be accepting towards myself for being exactly the kind of self I have often disparagedâ€¦ well, that insight might be more valuable than anything else I've recounted on this blog.
