<p>This time it's from <a href="http://www.zianet.com/ehusman/weblog/2007/05/mystery-socialist-wrap-up.html">Eric Husman</a>:<blockquote>The Left may not favor <em>the</em> police state, but they are for <em>a</em> police state. The Right is just the opposite: While they claim to be against <em>a</em> powerful, central government, they keep building <em>the</em> powerful, central government.</blockquote><p>Of course, he's entirely correct about the <em>establishment</em> Left and the Right.  And keep in mind that the generality or specificity of their authoritarianism changes in direct proportion to who's in power - in other words, the Right was all up in arms about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waco_Siege">militant</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Ridge">law</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elian_gonzalez">enforcement</a> in the not too distant past.  The establishment is defined by its pettiness, superficiality, lack of reflection, and most of all its sheer hypocrisy.</p>
