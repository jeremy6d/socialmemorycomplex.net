<a href="http://www.donotremove.net/mexigogue/archives/003326.html">Mexigogue</a> drops the logic on us... <u>why not blow up Iran?</u><blockquote>1: It is not ethical to attack someone on the hypothetical premise that they might be thinking about using their weapons against you. We have weapons and we might hypothetically be thinking about attacking our ideological enemies. Does that mean then that it's ethically ok for them to attack us?</blockquote>What a novel idea!
