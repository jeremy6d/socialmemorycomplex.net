<p>If you've been following <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/01/06/lima-ohio-drug-raid-gone-bad/">this story</a> then you know just how frightening <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2008/08/officers_cheer_police_shooting.html">this passage</a> is:</p><blockquote><p>A jury verdict that cleared a police officer in the drug-raid shooting death of an unarmed woman will allow other officers to do their job without hesitation, police union officials said.</p></blockquote><p>Because, clearly, unloading a hailstorm of bullets into a closed bedroom door in a house you know ahead of time has a family with children present is not something about which you should have the slightest hesitation whatsoever.  And hesitation (in other words <em>taking a moment to think about what you're doing</em>) is <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=893">something that cops have been told for years gets them killed</a>; therefore, end of story, no possible competing interests worthy of consideration from a public policy perspective at all, period.  Don't worry about that, officer; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eMkth8FWno">it's just a flesh wound</a>, and you're just doing your job.</p><p>If only we understood the unique, existential dilemma of police officers, doing a difficult, dangerous job day in and day out with so little appreciation!  Why can't the pussified public suck it up and understand that officers are <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/category/police-professionalism/">professionals</a> who are trained to do, well, whatever they feel like doing at any particular moment, which is by definition "professional" and "heroic" and <em>goddamnit <a href="http://www.policelink.com/news/43976-officer-acquitted-of-drug-raid-shooting-death#comment_form">who are you to question them, anyway</a></em>?  And we can't have any breaks in the thin blue line, so any officers who might disagree with Lima's professional law enforcement standards will dutifully shut up and let the press frame the entire profession's reaction to the verdict as "cheering".</p><p>I'll say it again: <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=928">if the only way you can do your job safely is by endangering others</a>, don't act like you're doing the rest of us any favors.  If you're going to frame this issue in a way that pits <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/01/11/lima-pd-pulls-animated-swat-image/">cops against citizens</a>, don't be surprised when you lose public support.</p>
