<p>Let's go down the list:<ul><li>My car is acting up, and it's the same problem I've gotten "fixed" (supposedly) about 10 times over the last 5 years.  So I don't want to take it in and have them arbitrarily replace some functioning part.  On the other hand, I'd like for the car to run without jerking back and forth (I think I have a fuel delivery issue).</li><li>My cell phone - the only phone I have - is broken.  Verizon Wireless is saying it's water damage, but I know that's not true.  It's complete bullshit, and I'm gonna have to either buy a new one or use a really old one a friend has.</li><li>My dog, Tela, has a growth on her ear.  She needs surgery and they're gonna take a sample for a fucking biopsy.  This is the worst, and it's gonna cost a bundle too.</li><li>Add on top of all this that we're looking to move because Tasha doesn't like where we live.  That means I need to have money for when we find a place.  Money is, as you can imagine, a somewhat limiting factor.</li><li>Tasha's got even more stress because of business and upcoming school.</li><li>My home computer is freaking out and sometimes won't even boot.  I haven't even had a chance to diagnose it.  Something really wierd's going on - could be the RAM, b/c the hard disk checked out last time I ran CHKDSK.</li></ul>Sorry, I'm not the kind to complain about my life, and I know there's so many who have it worse than I.  And it just makes it that much more ridiculous that I'm so stressed out over this stuff.  But all this has happened in the course of one week.</p><p>Just in case you want to know why I might be scarce the next few days or so.</p>
