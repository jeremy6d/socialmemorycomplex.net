Wow - <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a> is actually worth reading today.  Lots of good stories to peruse, the first obvious one being <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/mld/sunherald/10427343.htm">Rumsfeld getting hated on by Trent Lott</a>.  WTF?  I know I'm feeling a little under the weather, but am I actually hallucinating here?  The administration's butt boy revolts?<blockquote>"I'm not a fan of Secretary Rumsfeld," Lott, R-Mississippi, told the Biloxi Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday morning. "I don't think he listens enough to his uniformed officers."</blockquote>Maybe it has to do with <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1216/p01s01-usmi.html">this other story</a> about the soldiers getting zero intelligent support from this admin:<blockquote>Evidence includes numbers of deserters <b>(reportedly in the thousands)</b>, resignations of reserve officers, lawsuits by those whose duty period has been involuntarily extended, and a refusal to go on dangerous missions without proper equipment. There's also been a willingness at grunt level to publicly challenge the Pentagon - as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld found out recently in a trip to the war zone, where he got an earful about unarmored humvees.<i>  (My emphasis)</i></blockquote>But I'm sure the soldiers are still praying for Bush - which is good, since he'll need all the divine guidance he can get when he <a href="http://cnn.netscape.cnn.com/ns/news/story.jsp?id=2004121521290001739682&amp;dt=20041215212900&amp;w=APO&amp;coview=">shuts down the GPS system</a> to find the "evul turrists" (what, don't you <b>believe</b>?!?).  There's also <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20041214-090259-5700r.htm">a great article</a> in the <a href="http://www.washtimes.com">Washington Times</a> (for once) about the other shit we can expect in the next decade - and it's not all fire and brimstone.  And it's not in the distant future, either - look at how <a href="">Israel recognizes what the next big thing is</a> - and it's not us (maybe it's <i>Asian values</i>?).  Wow, where's all this Judeo-christian solidarity that I get shoved down my throat every time I question why we put that little mooch state's security above ours?  And it looks like <a href="http://www.canada.com/fortstjohn/story.html?id=f02a4367-b138-4f32-ae17-32da81fb4a02">I'm not the only one</a> who doesn't dig our "Bring it on, grab our balls, and flick off the world" excuse for a foreign policy that actually makes us less safe.

And the best news for the future of these united States?  <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1802&amp;ncid=1802&amp;e=1&amp;u=/washpost/20041216/ts_washpost/a2202_2004dec15">DC decided that Major League Baseball can't loot the pockets of city taxpayers to get rich.</a>  Am... I awake?  Is this a dream?

*pinches self*

Ooh... daddy likey...
