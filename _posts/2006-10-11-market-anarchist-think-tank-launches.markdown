Finally, we have an organization promoting market anarchism to the masses.  Announcing the <a href="http://c4ss.org/">Center for a Stateless Society</a>:
<blockquote><a href="http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm">The Molinari Institute</a>, a market anarchist think tank, today launched a new media effort aiming to put their agenda to abolish government front and center in US political discourse. Dubbing their project the Center for a Stateless Society (www.c4ss.org), institute officials laid out plans to publish and distribute news commentary written by anarchists with radically free-market oriented views on economics - taking market anarchism out of the realm of academia and obscure internet blogs in order to put it in the public eye.

Molinari Institute President <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/">Roderick Long</a> explained "For too long libertarians, and I mean anarchist libertarians, have treated market anarchism almost as an esoteric doctrine. It's time to put market anarchism front and center in our educational efforts, time to start making it a familiar and recognizable position. The Center for a Stateless Society aims to bring a market anarchist perspective to the popular press, rather than leaving it confined to scholarly studies and movement periodicals."</blockquote>
<a href="http://bradspangler.com">Brad Spangler</a> will serve as director, and hopefully I will be able to contribue some writing at some point.  Roderick's <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog/2006/10/10/center-for-a-stateless-society-launched-today/">appeal</a> for a popular, persuasive anarchist movement in this country mirrors my thoughts (as will be clear when my next post is published in a few hours).

Any suggestions on topics on which I could write?Â  I'm especially interested in those who are still skeptical about anarchism.
