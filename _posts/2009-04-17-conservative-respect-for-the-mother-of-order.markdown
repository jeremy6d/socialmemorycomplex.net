<blockquote>Spare me the mewling about “ordered liberty,” please - 50 years of conservative pieties about “ordered liberty” led to Dick Cheney and a movement full of “men” who dared not open their mouths to defend liberty when she needed it most. Give me disorderly hinterland rebels any day.</blockquote><p align=right>- <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/pdfissue.html?Id=AmConservative-2009apr20&page=35">Bill Kauffman</a></p>
