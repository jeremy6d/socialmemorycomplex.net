Which anti-American, anti-war magazine published an article that frames Obama's foreign policy decisions in the following "blame America" terms?

>The sad truth is everything we are seeing we have already seen. Despite presidents who come and go, permanent war is a hallowed American institution. Start if you will with the War of 1812, the invasion of Mexico, and the carnage of a Civil War. Move to the mass murder of Native Americans and theft of their property, the killing, torture, and prison camps in the Philippines, then the blood-drenched 20th century. The 21st likewise dawns red. It never changes. Doves protest, hawks rule, ordinary people pay the penalty. All wars are "just."

Hint: it's also the same magazine Time called "the most anti-Bush magazine of the [past] decade."

Here's the [answer](http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/). The biggest element missing from the anti-war movement is the anti-war part. Instead, you get a coalition of exotic interest groups around culture war and identity politics. Wake up - that's a language neocons speak easily (as long as the criticism can be focused beyond our borders; see the women's rights arguments for the Iraq invasion). 

But as the article goes on to explain, there's a rich history of antiwar conservatism (see [Bill Kauffman](http://www.amazon.com/Aint-America-Conservatism-Middle-American-Anti-Imperialism/dp/0805082441) on this topic) rooted in American traditions and sensibilities. And it took [a monumental upset in the conservative movement](http://www.ronpaul.com/) to override the prejudices and side projects of the modern, liberal, supposedly anti-war characters in this country. Shameful.
