<p>From Brad Spangler's <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/393">excellent breakdown</a> of the parallel interests of socialists and libertarians:<blockquote>We’re the Libertarian Left, and we’re the new Reds.</blockquote>Read his whole <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/393">post</a>: it's a good compendium of links related to the debate between the left and right wings of the libertarian movement.  I'm <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=378">still</a> catching up on <em><a href="http://mutualist.org/id47.html">Studies in Mutualist Political Economy</a></em> so I can't get into the mix on these things.  However, it's clear that this whole controversy over the <a href="http://www.mises.org/jlsdisplay.asp">JLS</a> symposium on Carsonian mutualism (see <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=422">here</a>) is exposing a lot of issues in the libertarian ideology that need clarification, discussion, and exploration.  What can I say: it's an exciting time to be anti-state!</p>
