Sorry I've been so sparse lately... there's not really any good excuse for it.  I've noticed that my blogging is governed by a cycle of sorts, and I have to go through a down time to get back to where I feel I have something worth saying.  Right now I'm pretty immersed in John Taylor Gatto's <a href="http://johntaylorgatto.com/underground/index.htm">The Underground History of American Education</a>, which is such a profound work that I'm really trying to absorb it all.  I'm also trying to work through a reread of <a href="http://mutualist.org/id47.html">Carson's book</a> to inform discussions with my friend <a href="http://eytom.com/blog/">Brady</a>.  In addition to that I've been working my ass off since I came back from the place at which I was contracting.  Now I'm working closely with one of my bosses on a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> web application and I'm having a blast.  It feels good to really be enjoying work, though.

So we just had Christmas dinner with Tasha's family and right now she and I are watching Rushmore.  Since I got some down time I thought I'd just say Merry Christmas and, well, I'm not dead.  I'm going to try to make the Molinari Society symposium on Friday, so if you're into market anarchism you should check it out.

Peace.
