<p>I'm presently in Louisville, KY visiting <a href="http://llresearch.org">L/L Research</a> as they're holding their <a href="http://llresearch.org/homecomings/homecoming_2007/homecoming_2007.htm">2007 Homecoming event</a>.  This year, it's a workshop on the energy centers of the body, popularly known as the chakras.  They are the keys to the underlying energetic dynamics of growth and experience that manifest spiritual, mental, and physical phenomena in our lives.  To understand the self, at some point one has to understand these dynamics, and the energy centers are the gateways to exploring this subtle science.</p><p>We've been studying <a href="http://llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_pdf.htm">our preferred source material</a> and having a sprawling conversation on the dynamics of energy flow, the nature of blockages and overactivations, and how this relates to the overall model of spiritual evolution articulated in the Law of One. I'm not sure I have a lot to say about it at this point, but I'm definitely learning a lot.  On top of that, I'm meeting a lot of new people other than the usual suspects at these events.  I've even had a chance to talk with some people about my political insights stemming from the Law of One and get feedback on it.  I can't say it's been a totally pleasant experience, for no progress is painless.  I'm also having to stay on top of the freelance work I'm doing, but I'm still glad I came.  It's good to reconnect to the spiritual in the company of like-minded souls.</p>
