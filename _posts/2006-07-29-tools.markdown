The P.A.T.R.I.O.T. Act and indefinite detentions of enemy combatants are two of the many "tools"<a href="http://www.911citizenswatch.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=901"> </a>the government claims it needs to combat terrorism.  Maybe they should pass a law having something to do with another tool - <a href="http://www.911citizenswatch.org/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=901">e-mail</a>:
<blockquote>An Arabic-speaking FBI agent had requested information about a Jan. 5, 2000, Al Qaeda meeting in Malaysia, but the CIA never turned it over, The New Yorker reported.

The ambitious FBI detective, Ali Soufan, was so upset when he eventually got the information - after 9/11 - that he vomited.</blockquote>
Let's get one thing straight: 9/11 happened not due to a lack of laws but due to a CIA and FBI who fucked it up.  They had everything they needed and they botched it.  Suck it up, but don't make the us citizens pay for your mistakes.

And don't patronize us by calling expansions of unchecked governmental authority "tools".  We know who the tools are.
