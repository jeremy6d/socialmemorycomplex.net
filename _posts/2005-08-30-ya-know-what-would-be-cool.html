<p>If we have time and Tasha is ok with it, I'd like to add something to our mini-honeymoon itenerary.  I'm thinking we take advantage of being in Austin, TX for the <a href="http://www.aclfest.com">Austin City Limits music festival</a> and take a trip down to Crawford, TX to visit <a href="ttp://news.google.com/news?hl=en&hs=Ho7&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&tab=wn&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=sheehan&btnG=Search+News">Camp Casey</a> and support the protests there.</p><p>It probably won't work out, but it would be awesome if it did.  If for no other reason, just to piss my conservative buds off.</p><p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/na/D8CAIA8O1.html">Camp Casey is closed</a>.  Pity.  I could have pissed Matt off even more than usual.</p>
