<p><s>If</s> When I'm finally in court, in front of the <s>military tribunal</s> jury, I shall confidently recite <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080812/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/mukasey_lawyers">this quote</a> from Attorney General Robert Mukasey:</p><blockquote><p>Not every wrong, or even every violation of the law, is a crime.</p></blockquote><p>I agree with him - not every violation of the laws on the books is a crime.  I'd wager that in the ten thousand or so federal laws out there just waiting to be inadvertently broken, any of us hapless citizens stand a way better chance on trial now that juries have a free pass from DOJ to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification">judge not merely whether a law was broken, but whether the totality of the facts constitute a "crime"</a> (something <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=942">I fully support</a>).</p><p>However, something tells me this is a judgment call to be made solely by bar members, not lowly plebs like us (excepting my favorite reader, <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/blog.html">Mr. X</a>, of course).</p><p>Hat tip <a href="http://www.theagitator.com/2008/08/12/on-enforcing-the-law">Radley's way</a>.</p>
