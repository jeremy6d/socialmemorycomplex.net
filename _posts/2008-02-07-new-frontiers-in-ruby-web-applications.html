<p>So as somebody who has experienced their share of headaches deploying Rails apps (and ended up learning how to provision a VPS from scratch as a result) I'm interested in the questions Peter Cooper of Ruby Inside <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/no-true-mod_ruby-is-damaging-rubys-viability-on-the-web-693.html">asks</a>:<blockquote><ol><li>Is there / why isn't there a version of mod_ruby that doesn't have the "class sharing" issue? What is the technical impediment?</li><li>Is there any immutable reason that Ruby apps couldn't, in the future, be deployed in a PHP-esque fashion?</li></ol></blockquote><p>The ensuing discussion in the comments is very instructive, and I've even been giving Cooper's <a href="http://switchpipe.org/">Switchpipe</a> project a bit of attention lately.  But <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra Zygmuntowicz</a> chimed in with quite welcome news:<blockquote><p>I'm just going to say that <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a> has support (as of today!) for running multiple instances of it's VM within one process, each VM on it's own *native* thread, each VM running many ruby green threads. Each VM has it's own heap and so each VM could load different apps that wouldn't interfere with each other. <em>We have plans for a mod_rubinius for apache that takes full advantage of this feature.</em> Stay tuned ;)</p></blockquote><p>I certainly will!</p>
