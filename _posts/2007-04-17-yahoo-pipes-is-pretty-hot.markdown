Pipes</a>, and I have really good things to say about it.  The interface is very pretty, snappy, and intutitive.  There's lots of modules into which you can pipe content, such as content analyzers, regular expression parsers, string and math functions, geocoding, etc.  I'd really like to come up with some ideas on mixing data sources to create some really useful or cool feeds.  If you have any ideas, let me know - or check it out yourself!
