<p>From <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2006/03/06/matts-bio/">Matt McIntosh</a>:
<blockquote>...I guess political infeasibility is the price you pay for getting to the heart of the matter.</blockquote>
So true.  It's little gems like that line which keep me going back to <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/">Catallarchy</a>, not to mention the <a href="http://catallarchy.net/blog/archives/2006/03/31/immigration-reality-check/">very astute observation</a> about the economics of illegal immigration from which that excerpt originated.  McIntosh makes the same points about "social engineering wars" that are always overlooked in politics.</p><p>As an aside, I had brought up <a href="http://rhog.blogspot.com/2006/03/quick-input-on-illegal-immigration.html#114419809392199029">similar issues</a> of enforcement to a conservative blogger whom I know.  You shouldn't simply be able to rattle a nationalistic saber and get the country to ask "how high" - you need to think this shit through, people.  But... that's a problem we've been having for some time, and I doubt this debate will put it to rest.</p>
