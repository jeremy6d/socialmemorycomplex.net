Two very important points I want to make:

1. <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.typepad.com">Right Thinking Girl</a> is definately my favorite blog right now.  I have significant problems with the author's politics and taste in music / culture, but I'll be damned if I don't enjoy myself more there than anywhere else on the net, especially some of the other cats who comment there.  Cool people apparently voted for Bush - news to me.  Anyway, I spend time there at the expense of here, and I'll try to correct that by being a more of a snotty libertarian.  Let it never be said that Jeremy doesn't assign props where props are due.  We beyond that.

2. Why aren't we hearing less about the geologists going on talk radio and CNN to talk about what would happen in the oh-so-impossible event that the east coast is hit by a tsunami - and more about <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/recenteqsww/Quakes/usteaf.htm">this</a>?!?!

Hi, blogosphere?  Yeah, it's me, "shit going on that you're not paying attention to".

Just kidding, I love y'all.

God, now I know why everybody loves/hates Evanescence (I can sorta see where David Cross is coming from).
