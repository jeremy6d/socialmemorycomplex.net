<p><img src="/assets/all-shirt.jpg" />I haven't <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=974">changed my mind</a>; I just want this shirt! You can get it at <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/jeremy6d">my Cafe Press shop</a>.  As with all my shirts, no markup is applied - it actually costs that much.</p>
