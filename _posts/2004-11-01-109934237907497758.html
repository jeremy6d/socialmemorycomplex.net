Here's a picture of Gary, Sabine, and me from our visit to Avalon in rural Kentucky.  Can you step to the vintage Libertarian campaign tee shirt?  No you cannot.

We had a lot of fun (I think this is right after Sabine wiped the floor with our American asses in a game of H-O-R-S-E).  Thanks to Gary and all the beautiful folks at <a href="http://llresearch.org">L/L</a> for hosting us.  Thanks to Sabine for making the leap of faith to go thousands of miles from home and hang out with some creepy guy on the internet.  Thanks to Tasha for putting up with me.

Aww, what the heck, another picture won't hurt.  Here's me and Tasha in front of the A.R.E.  Just don't forget to read <a href="http://6thdensity.net/blog/2004/11/ha-election-is-tomorrow.html">my election rant</a>!

Jeez, too pictures of me at new age hippy places.  What will <a href="http://www.acidlogic.com">Acid Logic</a> think of me?
