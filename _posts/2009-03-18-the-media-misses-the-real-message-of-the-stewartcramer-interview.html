excerpt: "&quot;When we can&#39;t compete with a comic in terms of speaking truth to power, then it&#39;s more clear than ever that journalism in the US has lost its way. It comes as no surprise then when, as newspapers crumble around the country, a report like the one released by the Pew Research Center this week says that only 33% of people would miss their local newspaper &quot;a lot.&quot; When you lead with a story about an interview that happened on a comedy show--and it&#39;s the very same story that almost everyone else is leading with as well--what&#39;s to miss?&quot;"
