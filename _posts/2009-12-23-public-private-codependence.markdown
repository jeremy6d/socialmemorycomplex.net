Everybody and their mother has invoked the old Mussolini quote about renaming fascism to "corporatism". It always surprises me how many different political conclusions this point is used to augment. For some, it means private business is bad because it takes advantage of a vulnerable democratic political process. For others, it means firms are enlisted into the agendas of big bad politicians, restraining the so-called "free market" competition that benefits us all. 

When considering each competing interpretation, it's most interesting and instructive to note which institution plays the victim. In other words, the quote is often used by people who assume the legitimacy of both big business and big government. The quibble lies solely with the relative power of one party relative to the other. Even radicals reinforce these established concepts: anarcho-capitalists must have an articulable definition of the corporation and of the government to be able to ensure the victory of one over the other. Same for radical communists.

Nobody ever considers the political climate in which Mussolini made this remark; nor do they consider the indeterminate nature of either concept. And so they divide themselves into left/right positions and jockey for supremacy without instead challenging the ground rules of the game. Take [this article by Nelson Hultberg](http://www.thedailybell.com/681/Nelson-Hultberg-The-Fed-is-a-Fascist-Cartel.html), where he advances a position in the debate about whether the Federal Reserve is a public or a private entity:

>For example, Exxon Corporation is considered a private corporation. So let's compare it to the so called "private" Federal Reserve corporation. Does Exxon have its CEO and board of directors appointed and confirmed by the government? No, but the Fed does. Are 97% of Exxon's profits turned over to the federal Treasury? No, but the Fed's profits are. Can Exxon be voted out of existence tomorrow by Congress? No, but the Fed can. Therefore despite what our courts maintain, the Fed is not a private corporation; it is a government run cartel.

However, this conclusion has so many false assumptions built into it as to be damn near useless. First of all, corporations most certainly _can_ be voted out of existence by a deliberative body, as corporations are chartered according to _laws_ that legislatures enact.
