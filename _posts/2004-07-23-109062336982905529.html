Alright, Friday!  Finally can put the meaningless drudgery of work behind me for 48 hours.  How will I spend it?  Going backpacking in <a href="http://www.nps.gov/shen/">Shenendoah National Park</a>.  I believe we're hiking in the central section, towards Bear Church Rock.  Tried to get my friend Bill to come along, but he commied out.  Sara, our friend from Richmond, is going.  Well, here comes Tasha, we best get going (first, we're going to see the Bourne Supremacy - what a dumb name for a movie.  Supposed to be pretty good, though).
