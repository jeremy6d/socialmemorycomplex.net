<p>Lawrence O'Donnel <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000972839">claimed</a> that Karl Rove leaked the identity of Valerie Plame to the press.</p><p>I don't really have a lot to say on the matter, but it's just creepy that this Administration will probably get off scott free on this, too.</p>
