<p><a href="http://ronpaul2008.com">Ron Paul</a> was on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUYDt7kC3Z0">Bill Maher</a>, and so was Ben Affleck.  Although I don't think he's <i>that</i> shallow, <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/13015">this monologue</a> really kicked ass:<blockquote><p>...you know what's funny about this fucking giveaway? The Democrats live in fear of basically, you know, being called cowards. Of looking soft on military. Of looking like pussies, basically. We're afraid that somebody's going to call us a pussy. That someone's going to criticize us. And these people got elected basically on opposing the war. They got sent to Washington to oppose the war. They went there to make a vote on opposing the war. And then, when they got sent back the bill to, you know, and they were told, "Look, you know, the President's not going to, you know, you have to put these, uh, you know, timelines in there, you know, you're either going to vote for or against this measure that says, you have to, if you want this money, you have to give us timelines to get out of Iraq. Are you going to be for this or against it?"</p><p>They were afraid that if they basically sent it back to the President and said, "No, we need the timelines," and they left, for Memorial Day vacation, that when they left, the President would criticize them when they went on vacation for not supporting the troops. In other wordsâ€¦While they were on vacation, they were afraid of being criticized. So rather, out of a fear of being criticized, they sacrificed their core political beliefs. And they wonder why people call them fucking weak.</p></blockquote>Also featured was the best bumper sticker slogan ever, for which I whipped up a quick pic:<div style="clear: all; text-align: center; margin: 1em;"><img style="border: 1px solid white;" id="image736" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/WoD_BumperSticker.jpg' alt="WoD_BumperSticker.jpg' /></div></p><p>Also, I upped countermeasures in the wake of an intense barrage of comment spam.  You may have to go through a kaptcha to comment.  Sorry, but this is a temporary relief step while I clean all this shit out.</p>
