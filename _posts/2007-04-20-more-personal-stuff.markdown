	<li>Last night, Tasha and I saw <a href="http://flaminglips.com">the Flaming Lips</a> at <a href="http://www.thenorva.com/">the NorVa</a> in Norfolk, Virginia.  It was an awesome show, with lots of balloons, confetti, and streamers, and a huge LCD screen behind them playing stuff, and everybody had laser pointers.  Yes, it was my first time seeing them - how could you tell?

The concert was a lot of fun, and I enjoyed the music.  I find Wayne Coyne to be a painfully inarticulate, but nevertheless sincere, speaker.  Last night was one occasion when I would rather have not heard his opinions on current events - which isn't necessarily to say I disagreed with them. But other than that, it was a great experience.  Tasha says it was her favorite concert ever.</li>
