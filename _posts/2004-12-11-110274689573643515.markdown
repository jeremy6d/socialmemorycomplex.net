You know what?  I'm tired of fighting about politics.

Seriously.

I'm sick of it.  I just want to have my beliefs, and live my life.  Of course, that's precisely why I became a libertarian, but whatever.

I don't want to shove my beliefs down others' throats.  Really, I don't.  I just wish that what other people thought didn't affect me.  Frankly, my fellow Americans scare the hell out of me.  And not just the Bushites.  There's a whole crapload of liberal-progressives that have just as puritan of an agenda, and all the moral high ground they need to whip the country into Stalinist shape.  Downright fricking scary.

I guess the best thing that could happen might be if the two extreme wings could just kill each other off, leaving moderates in the middle.  What we really need is a newfound distrust of the state, but I'll settle for a simple civil war.

But seriously, I think the answer to this for me is to politick locally.  I have all the respect in the world for Libertarians who work the national circuit every four years with no hope of victory, but I just don't think I can handle it.  I can barely handle state politics.  Maybe I just need to find someplace I like - someplace where I actually can see myself caring what others think.

Bah, I'm tired.  Or as the say here in Tappahannock, "tard".
