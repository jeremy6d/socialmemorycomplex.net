There were some frustrations in the beginning, but I suppose they were to be expected.  Somehow things just worked out... I had <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=511">a problem with screen resolution</a> for which I was able to find a quick hack.  Then I couldn't get Xubuntu to recognize the NIC, so I popped it out to check the manufacturer and model (according to <a href="http://nongeeksight.blogspot.com/2006/07/experience-xubuntu.html">nongeek's instructions</a>, thanks man!).  While I couldn't locate the correct driver in the lib directory (no Dell drivers I could find), I found out that just by reseating my NIC it was recognized!  Finally, it wasn't too painful to get Internet Connection Sharing working with my windows machine to give internet access to the Xubuntu box... and now I'm online!

All in all for a brand new OS, not bad... not bad at all.
