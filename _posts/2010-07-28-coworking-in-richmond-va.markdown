I'm interested in establishing a [co-working](http://coworking.com/) community in Richmond, Virginia. To that end, I've taken the initiative in setting up a wiki page for anybody who's interested. If there's interest, I'd like to put together a regular "[jelly](http://workatjelly.com)" somewhere centrally located in Richmond to start. That's a nice, informal way for people to see if this is something worth expanding.

Please visit / edit [wiki.workatjelly.com/rva](http://wiki.workatjelly.com/rva) and provide your ideas, suggestions, and contact information.
