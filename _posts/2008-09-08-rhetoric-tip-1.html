<p>If somebody responds to a point you made by (1) prefacing their response with "I have no idea what you're talking about," (2) going on to address precisely the point you were originally intending to make, then you can be sure that they probably <em>did</em> have some idea all along what you were talking about. Ooh, <em>busted</em>!</p>
<p>But that's ok - we all have our rhetorical tactics.  And you two are still on my short list of favorite bloggers / libertarians.</p>
