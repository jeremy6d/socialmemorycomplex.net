Sometimes, it's just too much.  Not days after <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=561">I called out a well-known capitalist</a> for his anti-market rhetoric, Right Thinking Girl - that most vulgar of vulgar capitalists - <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com/2006/11/02/my-day-so-far/">gives me some more material</a> along the same lines. And both bitch fests are about hotels and eco-friendly policies.Â  It's great to throw your money around and cheer about capitalism and shopping and 'Mercka, until - oops! - the market aggregates values and demand in a way you don't approve.  Then it's those evil liberals allying with Al Qaeda to deny you fresh sheets.

But screw going to a different hotel that caters to your high-falutin', jet-setting, glamorous lifestyle.  You're a Republican, and America OWES you a hotel - in your price range - that doesn't conserve resources or appeal to your non-existent environmental consciousness.  I mean, wake up, 'Mercka - is George W. Bush not president?  Hello?

I swear to God, her and I are not colluding - she actually writes this stuff.  I just happen to make fun of it.  By all means, go check out <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com">her blog</a> and have yourself a laugh.
