Hey, this is hella interesting: check out <a href="http://newworlddisorder.ca/">New World Disorder</a>, as well as the nifty <a href="http://www.newworlddisorder.ca/blog/">blog</a> with cool pictures and articles.  Reading this blog makes me realize I have a long way to go to make my blog cool.  I think I need more posts on metaphysics and spirituality.  But check out the <a href="http://www.llresearch.org">L/L Research</a> and <a href="http://www.Ascension2000.com">Ascension2000 (David Wilcock)</a> links.  That's good background on where I'm coming from, so read up young ones.  And yes, there will be a test.
