Whoever said the U.S. military is a source of undying patriotic faith <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/06/30/wiran30.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/06/30/ixportal.html">never had to count on the British</a>.  Jeez.<blockquote>America's military commander in Iraq ordered British troops to prepare a full-scale ground offensive against Iranian forces that had crossed the border and grabbed disputed territory, a senior officer has disclosed.

An attack would almost certainly have provoked open conflict with Iran. But the British chose instead to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels.

"If we had attacked the Iranian positions, all hell would have broken loose," a defence source said yesterday.

"We would have had the Iranians to our front and the Iraqi insurgents picking us off at the rear."</blockquote>I resent Gen. Sanchez for making me indebted to the British Army.
