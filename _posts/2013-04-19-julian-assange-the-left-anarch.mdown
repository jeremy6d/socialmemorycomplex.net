This passage from [the interview of Julian Assange by Google CEO Eric Schmidt](http://wikileaks.org/Transcript-Meeting-Assange-Schmidt?nocache) exemplifies the kind of radicalism I most admire.  Notice the lack of a clean, rationalist philosophy or any sanctimonious univeralist moral bravado.

> I looked at something that I had seen going on with the world. Which is that I thought there were too many unjust acts... And I wanted there to be more just acts, and fewer unjust acts. And one can sort of say, well what are your philosophical axioms for this? And I say I do not need to consider them. This is simply my temperament. And it is an axiom because it is that way. And so that avoids, then, getting into further unhelpful discussions about why you want to do something. It is enough that I do.

The rest of the interview has some fascinating insights, anecdotes, and theory on networks, social movements, politics and conspiracies, technology, and even ontology (never knew URLs were so deep).  Highly, highly recommended!
