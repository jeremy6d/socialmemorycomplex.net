Note to Ms. Zipp: mixing politics with work is not smart.  Take it from somebody who works in an office full of Republicans.  If you make politics an issue at work, you should totally be hired / fired over it.  It's one thing to seek out a person who has political beliefs and activities on his or her own time.  It's quite a different thing when an editor of your magazine formally associates the magazine with an ideology.  She says:

<blockquote>"I just wanted to let you know of the fear the liberal left has about a woman with power possessing Republican views."</blockquote>

It's just not cool to be a Republican... people need to stop acting like it is.
