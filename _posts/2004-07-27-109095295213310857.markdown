From the pioneers at <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org">CorpWatch.org</a>, <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11460">a reminder about the true nature of John Kerry's campaign</a>:<blockquote>This week John Kerry will accept the Democratic nomination to run for United States President at a gathering in Boston that will cost over $95 million to produce, the most expensive political party convention in history. The Fleet Center, a sports and entertainment arena where the meeting is being held, is named after the powerful FleetBoston Corporation, the biggest donor to Kerry's Congressional career, a company typical of the corporate benefactors floating the Democratic and Republican parties ever higher on a sea of special-interest cash.

Kerry may denounce the corrupting influence of special interests and big business and he may praise the Federal Election Campaign Act banning "soft money," the unchecked expenditures of special-interest money that distorted past elections and subverted federal limits on campaign contributions. But he may be a little more bashful about the $1.25 million dollar donation by Fleet Boston Financial to the Democratic convention host committee.</blockquote>I have no problem with people who support the Democratic platform, or the Republican platform, when they honestly believe in them.  But when people try to tell me that Republicans seek to be compassionate, or Democrats seek to break the corporate influence on politics, I really have to wonder whether they ever watch anything but campaign commercials.

I wonder how Democrats feel about the <a href="http://www.guerrillanews.com/government/doc4915.html">free speech zone</a>.  Probably the same way Republicans feel about prescription drug coverage - a neccessarily self-serving, hypocritical evil.  "Don't blame us, the terrorists took away your right to exercise free speech, not us!"  Who is standing up to this?  Who is holding the gov't - not a bunch of theoretical villains - accountable for this blatantly unconstitutional infringement on the rights of the people?  NOBODY.  I'll be goddamned if I vote for a Republican or Democrat.
