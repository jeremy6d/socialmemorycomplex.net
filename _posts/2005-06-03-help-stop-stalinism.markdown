Just when you think we can't become any less American in the U.S.A., Congress has to outdo itself.  Check <a href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=28">this</a> out:<blockquote>Congressman Sensenbrenner's (R-Wis.) draconian mandatory minimum sentencing bill will have serious consequences for our democracy, requiring you to spy on all your neighbors, including going undercover and wearing a wire if needed. Refusing to become a spy for the government would be punishable by a mandatory prison sentence of at least two years.

If you "witness" certain drug offenses taking place or "learn" that they took place you would have to report the offense to law enforcement within 24 hours and provide "full assistance" in the investigation, apprehension, and prosecution of the people involved. Failure to do so would be a crime punishable by a mandatory two year prison sentence.</blockquote>Click on <a href="http://action.downsizedc.org/wyc.php?cid=28">this link</a> to do something about it.
