Nobody except the most insufferable globalist would deny the consequence of racial, ethnic, or cultural identity. It has emerged as a defining 

Among the most ardent culture warriors of the Left, those who champion the concept of white skin privilege 

White skin privilege is permission to disregard opinions. Either the privilege _necessarily_ exists, in which case nothing that is said can be trusted to be a genuine, non-privileged critique. Nothing I say can be trusted unless it conforms totally with the leftist orthodox view. Or the privilege doesn't necessarily exist, and whites can work in common cause as equals with non-privileged types without inevitably destroying their identity.

Of course, whites should not help where help is not requested, and they should respect any request to leave groups of color or other group.

The point is not to defend white interests in the sense of superiority or even separatism, but to question whether a privilege identified is necessarily helpful to emphasize. Indeed, current leftists would do well to return to the class-based struggles of the 19th century socialists. There is more opportunity to build an authentic political identity if it does not try to co-opt or politicize other types of identity, but instead augments their struggles with a larger one.
