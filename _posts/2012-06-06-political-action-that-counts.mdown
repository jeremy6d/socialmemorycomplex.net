[Scott Walker won his recall election](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/scott-walker-wins-wisconsin-recall-election-tom-barrett-defeated/2012/06/06/gJQAXmmmIV_story.html), and [labor has suffered a genuine defeat](http://lbo-news.com/2012/06/06/walkers-victory-un-sugar-coated/). Maybe [the words of Big Bill Haywood](http://www.iww.org/en/history/library/Haywood/GeneralStrike) can give us some perspective on the place of elections in the struggle and where we might go from here:

> The Industrial Workers of the World is an economic organization without affiliation with any political party or any non-political sect. I as an Industrialist say that industrial unionism is the broadest possible political interpretation of the working-class political power, because by organizing the workers industrially you at once enfranchise the women in the shops, you at once give the black men who are disfranchised politically a voice in the operation of the industries; and the same would extend to every worker. That to my mind is the kind of political action that the working class wants. You must not be content to come to the ballot box on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, the ballot box erected by the capitalist class, guarded by capitalist henchmen, and deposit your ballot to be counted by black-handed thugs, and say, "That is political action." You must protect your ballot with an organization that will enforce the mandates of your class. _I want political action that counts. I want a working class that can hold an election every day if they want to._ (my emphasis)
