Well, fuck me. I watched this "American Idol" show for the first time ever last night and it was a scary kind of fun.  And provided this <a href="http://idol-mania.com/american-idol-fan/2007/01/25/american-idol-rachel-zevita/">Rachel Zevita</a> character is of legal age, I hereby declare my intention to have a passionate affair with her (since she's kicked out of conservatory now). She has everything I want in a woman: attitude, disobedience, style, classical training, and braces.  :swoon: Plus, she sang a Jeff Buckley song!

And that, folks, is why I don't have cable.  It's not because I think I'm better than you; it's because I'm super impressionable.
