<p>Just saw this <a href="http://www.netflix.com/MovieDisplay?movieid=70012015&trkid=90529">cult classic</a> last night, and I definately enjoyed it.  However, I expected it to be... I dunno, a little deeper?  I like the way it's done (the innocent kitchiness of the dialogue and characters), and the time travel concept is pretty cool, but the whole movie's point - i.e. how it ends, which I won't give away, just seems a little shallow.  Maybe I need to watch it again, though.</p>
