It <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=674">was</a> the head gasket (why didn't <a href="http://fettysservicecenter.com/">they</a> check that first?). So $500 in labor fixing things that aren't broke and not fixing the problem - mechanics are way too much like IT professionals. They should at least give me a break on the price since they didn't fix it (and take some of their new parts back that do me no good).
