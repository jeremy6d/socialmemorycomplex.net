excerpt: "&quot;If Leedskalnin and/or others really did have the an understanding of the universe that made a perpetual-motion machine possible, by all means we should try to discover it. The reason we don&#39;t is that too many self-interested parties fear what the discoveries might lead to. And that&#39;s one reason to distrust offices of power and those who hold them.&quot;"
