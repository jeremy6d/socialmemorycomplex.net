<p>Anybody who thinks that making fun of bad, oversentimental tributes to 9/11 is "unamerican" or "unpatriotic" <a href="http://www.americawestandasone.com/video.html">never saw this video</a>.  It's a slap in the face of the nation worse than any leftist protestor or crappy children's poem or even Michelle Malkin.</p><p>I think we should definately capture this guy dead or alive before bin Laden.</p><p>Hat tip to <a href="http://dadahead.blogspot.com/2005/04/worst-thing-ever-or-best-thing-ever.html">Dadahead</a>.</p>
