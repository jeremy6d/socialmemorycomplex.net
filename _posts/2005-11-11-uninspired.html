<p>I'm just not inspired to write lately.</p><p>The fraud that is the Bush Administration seems to be in full retreat.  Not a lot going on in my personal life.  Job takes a lot of my time lately - and as interesting as it is, it consumes much of my daytime resources.</p><p>So I apologize for not being up for blogging lately.  I'm still keeping up on things, but it's strange how internet habits morph and change over time.  I think probably the biggest reason I blog less is the retirement of Right Thinking Girl.  The conversation always stimulated my political ideas, and I'm still looking for another blog that is as wrong - but tolerant of correctness - as that one was.</p><p>Lately I've been extremely interested in anarchism and <a href="http://mutualism.org">mutualism</a>.  I may have some stuff to write about that at some point.  Right now I'm regrouping; at least, that's what it feels like.  Bear with me.</p><p>UPDATE: Maybe <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/11/11/D8DQE8480.html">this</a> could spur me to blog.</p><p>Meh.</p>
