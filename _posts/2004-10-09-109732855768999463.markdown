Last night I finally got in touch with my old friend from King George, Matt.  Matt and I go way back to like middle school.  He actually posted on <a href="http://lsblog.com/matt">his blog</a> about me calling him up last night, and mentions meeting me in middle school for the first time.  I don't remember that, but I tried to forget Middle School band as soon as possible.

Anyway, it was good to catch up with him.  He's living in Richmond - I'm trying to get to Richmond.  We both do work with MS Access databases, so that's wierd.  We're gonna try to get together next week.  I hadn't gotten back in touch with him for an hour, and I was already trying to run his personal life via the comments section of his blog.  I'm awful.

Here's to you Matt!
