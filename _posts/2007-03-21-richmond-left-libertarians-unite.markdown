<img id="image652" alt="ALL-symbol.png' style="margin: 3px; float: right" src="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org/images/allsymbol.gif' />I'm pleased to announce the <a href="http://richmond.leftlibertarian.org">Richmond Left Libertarian Alliance</a>.  Here's the <a href="http://richmond.indymedia.org/newswire/display/12781/index.php">announcement</a> I made on Richmond IMC:
<blockquote>The Richmond Left Libertarian Alliance is intended to be an activist organization for allowing left-leaning libertarians and libertarian-leaning leftists to work together to achieve common goals. By serving as a facilitator for dialogue, strategic planning, and solidarity with the larger activist movements in the Richmond area, the RLLA hopes to help push the common ground shared by all advocates of individual freedom and opponents of institutional privilege and violence.</blockquote>
In the coming weeks I'll be posting more information at the site in anticipation of our May Day kickoff meeting.  Watch the site for updates.
