<p>The Living the Law of One Seminar is over.  Sunday night we participated in a Q'uo session, and today was spent visiting Avalon.  I had some great conversations and really connected with people.  I also feel reenergized about the Law of One material and living a spiritually activated life.  Hopefully my blog will begin to reflect that more.  I think I just find the sacred and spiritual too valuable to write about it as flippantly as I treat many topics here on the blog.</p><p>My ticket from Louisville to Virginia was cancelled without my knowledge, and I didn't get the bad news till I got to the ticket counter ready to leave.  Turns out if you don't take the departing flight on a round trip they cancel the return flight.  Retarded - but even more retarded than that is the fact that I asked <i>specifically</i> about this and the Expedia agent told me I could do it the way I was planning (not take the departing flight, just the return).  So after an hour on the phone with Expedia I finally got treated fairly, bought a ticket for tomorrow morning, and came back to the L/L house.  So I'm chilling with Gary and Paul now, and should probably think about getting to bed... what a week!</p>
