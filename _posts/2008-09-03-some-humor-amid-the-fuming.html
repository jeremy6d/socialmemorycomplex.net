<p>Although the Monty Python skit resemblance is more than a function of the accents (the timing is amazing), this is <s>an honest-to-God</s> a believable portrayal of a typical politician here.  Are these the people we need to worry about?  Part of me feels like the way you deal with a police state is by ignoring the politicians, who after all never lift a finger to do anything, and attacking the apparatus: <em>the police</em>.  Whether politically, legally, or extra-legally, it seems to me that if we've genuinely <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1058">passed the point of no return</a>, it's not the politicians we need to bring in line but the people who execute their will.</p><p>UPDATE: This is not a real interview.  Hat tip to <a href="http://praxeology.net/blog">Roderick Long</a> for the <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1066#comment-96644">smooth catch</a>.  Serves me right for just parroting what a friend wrote in an <em>email forward</em>!</p>
