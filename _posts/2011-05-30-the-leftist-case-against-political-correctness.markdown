## Why should the Left care about the hurt feelings of bigots?

As a longtime libertarian and an avowed egalitarian socialist, I've struggled with the concept of "political correctness" (PC) for as long as I've had a political awareness. I went through a neoliberal democrat phase in the 90's where what many denounced as PC simply looked like good manners to me. Don't get me wrong: some of it was just that, the attempts of well-meaning people to navigate a culture permeated with deep-seated privilege and oppressive features. And yet, just as much polite talk is not exceedingly honest, I always had a nagging suspicion that PC habits were something more than mere social graces.

So this essay has been a long time coming for me, as I try to figure out where I fit in on the Left. My heart is in the struggle for an egalitarian, enlightened, peaceful world. But I don't consider leftism a religion, and the impulse of many to treat it as such -- to codify and regulate the behavior of people according to its tenets -- too often looks like a movement going through the motions instead of genuinely challenging the human condition. Indeed, my argument is that political correctness, far from being genuine compassion and anti-bigotry, has transformed into a cosmetic substitute for authentic radicalism. The goal of this essay is to start a conversation within the Left about our means, not our ends.

I was finally convinced to explore my feelings and write something concrete on the matter by watching [this video](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/the-big-picture/2783-Correctitude), brought to my attention by my comrade  [DBZero](http://dbzer0.com/blog/youre-not-an-underdog-fighting-political-correctness-youre-just-a-bigot). You should watch it first before reading the rest of the essay, because although I don't consider it the complete or even best case for the PC mindset, I certainly think it captures the spirit.

Now, to clear something up from the get-go: yes, the video makes a completely valid point about bigots hiding their words and actions behind the defense of "political incorrectness". Many on the right oppose the massive social changes that have altered forever the cultural landscape of language, stereotypes, and relationships that mainstream society considers acceptable. Whatever else can be said about the progressive movement, they have marketed the anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic, and other allied approaches quite successfully.

Let's not let straight white males off the hook, either. After all, it's certainly quite convenient for us to regard all this social change as something more than Western culture's emerging conscience, especially when it lays so much blame at the feet a culture in which we are not just privileged but with which we are both comfortable and in tune. Given this, one could easily perceive PC as a massively coordinated attack on straight white male identity -- one with deep roots, however odious and steeped in supremacism they may be. Now, I don't view it that way, but being a straight white male, I certainly see how it _could_ be interpreted in such a light, if I hadn't taken on the work of educating myself about how power and privilege actually function.

The video really nails the attempt some on the Right have made to play the victim card, as if they are being oppressed by social pressures to any degree comparable to legacy outgroups. If anything, this clever use of the enemy's weapon says a lot about the modern society we all find ourselves in. The last fifty years have seen tremendous upheavals in social mores and cultural stigmas. If one cannot fight against the prevailing winds and reestablish privilege, one can at least tack one's sails to the wind and reframe one's desire for the good ol' days as, hey, just another civil rights movement.

There is no question that the people who cry "political correctness" often have an agenda that has nothing to do with combatting genuine identitarian oppression and everything to do with excusing privilege. But does that mean that there are no problems with the PC regime -- to the extent it exists, at least? Do we perhaps underestimate not only the scope of this new dynamic in society but also the way it is used? Perhaps straight white males aren't victims of PC, but does that then mean it is harmless? In a world conforming more and more completely to the liberal social consensus, the radical Left abstains from staking out a comprehensive position at its own peril.

## The Origins of Political Correctness
  - research the use by the new left and its pejorative connotations on the left

Like the video's producer, I am no scholar on this matter. There has been much written on this matter, but very little from a left libertarian or anarchist viewpoint. My credentials extend to having grown up during the whole 1990's "culture war" bullshit and that's about it. However, I think Wikipedia's [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness) on political correctness provides a jumping off point for beginning to research the evolution of the term. Rather than dismiss the term as a bigotry-enabler and nothing more, I want to treat it as a genuine social phenomenon so that we can evaluate it as a total concept rather than a catch phrase. Only then can we tease out what is and is not problematic about it.

The video traces the use of the term back to the eighteenth century, but most modern use stems from the sociological attitude of the New Left. The so-called "revolution of '68" factors prominently into the most intellectually robust critiques of PC from the Right. For instance, Patrick Buchanan traces the origins of PC as we know it back to the Frankfurt School of the middle twentieth century. Herbert Marcuse in particular is singled out for his role in formulating "critical theory". Of course, the Right profits by linking PC culture to so-called "cultural marxism", i.e. explanations for the failure of class struggle that rely on identifying and undermining cultural features of robust capitalist societies. While I think this "conspiracy theory" is not completely without merit, it is also rather unsympathetic towards concerns I share. Let's say that political correctness was born in academia and leave it at that.

The importance of academia in the rise of PC rests first of all on the emergence of the New Left counterculture of the late 60's. This movement was populated overwhelmingly by college students who sought to end not just the Vietnam War but also what they viewed as the enabling lifestyle, culture, mindset, economy, etc. The prescriptions for changing the culture could vary from the intentionally absurd to deeply serious and probingly psychological.

Colleges and universities were not merely the setting of the New Left movement. It's important to my argument to note that they were the closest, and therefore the first, institutions in which activists could advance their popular agenda. Now, it is commendable how many in the movement did not block out the rampant injustice of the era and made their schools part of the struggle for change. Indeed, the centrality of campus politics in the movement ensured that academia would be ground zero for its continuation and transformation. This institution's mechanics was not only understood and tested, but also preserved a steady flow of youth -- a veritable fountain of counterculture population without limit.

The influence of 60's activists on academic institutions began to be felt in the 80's and 90's with such policies as speech codes. Without the militancy of its counterculture origins, the philosophy had only institutional 

Of course, the video almost conveys the impression that political correctness is a pejorative made up of whole cloth by the Right. Even its current sense had its origins in the libertarian wing of the New Left. For instance, 

There's a mythos on the intellectual Right that PC arose during the New Left era's embrace of the Frankfurt School's cultural marxism 
	
1. Origin of political correctness, history of cultural marxism

2. Political correctness as the institutionalization of the leftist agenda



	* 

3. The problems with the politically correct approach
	* It tries to compel people to change their behavior without changing their minds
	* It is itself bullying
	* It allows bigotry to be masked instead of apprehended
	* It facilitates institutional control
	* it is not the function of a language or vocabulary or grammar to protect feelings or make people feel better about themselves or even to prevent oppression. It is the function of a language to provide a medium for communication. INdividuals must 
	* Many of the changes in social norms that have emerged in the last 50 years (acceptance of minorities, more sex education, understanding people different than one, etc.) would have emerged faster if they hadn't been stigmatized and dismissed on unmerited grounds. PC encourages stigmatized views on the other side to be dismissed on unmerited grounds instead of openly challenged.

4. Toughening up the left
	* 
- we have to separate _offense_ from _oppression_. Can they be related? Sure. But conflating them only serves to widen the scope of the leftist project to the universal. If our goal is to make minorities coddled, ot only are they different concepts, they call upon different 

- white males may see denouncing "political correctness" as a sort of David and Goliath conceit, but that's not totally unfounded if PC is the newspeak of the corporate consensus

- offense is not the worse thing. Feeling offended means you're alive! But turning feelings into political grievances is not always justified.
	- much of the reason insensitive people hide behind political incorrectness is because offended people turn their offense from personal offense into thoughtcrime. If "politically incorrect" people are really just mean, then "politically offended" people are not a class of special victim; they are simply offended, which is neither a crime nor a tragedy. This is not to minimize cultures of domination, oppression, and discrimination - it is instead to make sure that we attack cultures, and not make people scapegoats (since people change their values differently, see On Changing Our World)

- political correctness could be thought of as pure marketing

- it epitomizes the elitist side of the left by holding that people must be tricked or trained to hold enlightened values
