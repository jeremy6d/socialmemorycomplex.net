Does this sound like a certain left libertarian group you know?

> It is true that there existed among us "social study groups", but we know how ephemeral and precarious they were: born out of individual caprice, these groups were destined to disappear with it; those who made them up did not feel united enough, and the first difficulty they encountered caused them to split up. Furthermore, these groups do not seem to have ever had a clear notion of their goal. Now, the goal of an organization is at one and the same time thought and action. In my experience, however, those groups did not act at all: they disputed. And many reproached them for building all those little chapels, those talking shops.

This is Amedee Dunois at the 1907 International Anarchist Congress in Amsterdam. Read the full speech [here](http://robertgraham.wordpress.com/anarchy-and-organization-the-debate-at-the-1907-international-anarchist-congress/). We can learn a lot from the example of those who have gone before.
