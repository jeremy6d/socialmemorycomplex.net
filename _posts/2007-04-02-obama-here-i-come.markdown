According to <a href="http://www.selectsmart.com/plus/select.php">this quiz</a>, I should vote for Obama next year (with 100% certainty, to boot).  That's great, because the quiz is designed with my likely priorities in mind.  I don't even have to think about the issues - just use their handy little script to tally up my citizen's duty!

Here's a taste of this magnificent, ground breaking quiz:
<ul>
	<li>Do I support big government pro-labor policies or big government pro-business policies?</li>
	<li>Taxpayer funded private education options or taxpayer funded compulsory State education only?</li>
	<li>Fascist free trade or fascist protectionism?</li>
	<li>Handouts for the world or occupations for the world?</li>
</ul>
Thank God I live in a country where I'm free to choose.
