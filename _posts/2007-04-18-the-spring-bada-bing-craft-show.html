Apparently, I will be DJing - although I sincerely doubt they want me to break out my turntable and jungle vinyls.  I'll probably just make a playlist on my iPod.

There's also a feature in <a href="http://www.brickweekly.com/">Brick Weekly</a> about the group <a href="http://rcm-offtherecord.blogspot.com/2007/04/proof-that-were-hot-vendor-spotlight.html">coming up</a>, for which they did a photo shoot on Tuesday.  Tasha is, of course, holding the teapot up front. Don't they look hep in their black clothes and grungy urban background?
