<img style="margin: 3px; float: left" src="http://tashamckelvey.com/images/tasha_throwing1_tg8j.jpg' />Congratulations to my girl: she's the <a href="http://www.etsy.com/featured_seller.php?id=53">featured seller</a> on <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy</a>, a Web2.0-style site for artists and crafts people to share and sell their work! Lately she's been expanding her online presence with <a href="http://potterybytasha.blogpost.com">two</a> <a href="http://artisanbusiness.blogspot.com">blogs</a>, her <a href="http://tashamck.etsy.com">Etsy page</a>, and <a href="http://tashamckelvey.com">a new site for her work</a> (which she did herself to dazzling effect).  I'm very proud of her - she works a hell of a lot harder than most people I know.  She's intensely creative, yet has kept her business afloat through thick and thin.  I admire and love her very much (which she already knows, but like most girls she wants to hear me say it).
