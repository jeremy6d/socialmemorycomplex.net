<ul>
	<li>What is an archetype?
	<ul>	<li>Way of making sense of experience</li>
                    <li>Kant: common tools for analyzing experience
	            <ul>	<li>We carry tools for understanding whereever we go</li>
				    <li>Two <i>categories</i> of analysis / thinking:
				    <ul>	<li>Understanding: <i>thing in itself</i>, linear</li>
					             <li>Reason: Non-linear, reflexive, transcendent function</li>
				    </ul></li>
				    <li>Reason must be tempered</li>
		   </ul></li>
		   <li>Kant left open wide field of investigation into nature of causation</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Ra laid out three archetypical study methods
	<ul>	<li>Tarot</li>
		    <li>Astrology</li>
		    <li>Kabbalah</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>The Ra group studied Tarot
	<ul>	<li>Three groups of seven categories</li>
		<li>Mind, body, spirit group of each systemic set</li>
		<li>Systemic set:
		<ul>	<li>Matrix</li>
			<li>Potentiator</li>
			<li>Catalyst</li>
			<li>Experience</li>
			<li>Significator</li>
			<li>Transformation</li>
			<li>Great Way</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Additional archetype of the choice (the fool)</li>
		<li>Archetypical systems of previous races in the universe had fewer (3) categories</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>All archetypes of tarot meant to be studied <i>in relation to each other</i> rather than singly</li>
	<li>Matrix
	<ul>	<li>Baseline "clay" of experiential condition - <b>simple awareness</b></li>
		<li>Background of meditation experience</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Potentiator
	<ul>	<li>That which <i>biases</i> us from within</li>
		<li>Present in meditation</li>
		<li>The potential and possibilities</li>
		<li>"Awaits the reaching"</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Experience
	<ul>	<li>Most easily understood - the experience of life and consciousness</li>
		<li>"Contains" matrix and potentiator</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Catalyst
	<ul>	<li>Point of discovery</li>
		<li>Motivates action in a direction depending on preexisting archetypal conditions</li>
		<li>Realizes the potential</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Significator
	<ul>	<li>Gives significance to experience</li>
		<li>Stamps and categorizes events</li>
		<li><b>Paired with choice</b></li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Choice
	<ul>	<li>Governs the choice of polarity between <i>service to self</i> and <i>service to others</i></li>
		<li>Key governor of experience that determines outcomes in other systematic areas</li>
		<li>Tied into significator by determining what "kind" of significance is given to experience and catalyst</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Transformation
	<ul>	<li>Change</li>
		<li>All archetypes contain transformation, but this one is a gateway to the great way</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Great Way
	<ul>	<li>The totality of synthesized experience in harmony and balanced</li>
		<li>Proportions of these various dimensions are configured</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Why do we have archetypes?
	<ul>	<li>System for understanding perfection of creator</li>
		<li>Way of integrating our partial perspective into the perfect unity of the creation (macrocosm)</li>
		<li>Way of integrating the creation within (microcosm)</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>First distortion: <u>Free will</u>
	<ul>	<li>Historical, transcendental problem of all religions and philosophies</li>
		<li>Why is there evil in a perfect creation?</li>
		<li>Why are there imperfect creatures in this creation?</li>
		<li>Explanation: <b>gift of creator experiencing self</b>
		</li><li>Creator is NOT complete: <b>there is something to be discovered</b> <i>in / of</i> the Creator <i>by</i> the Creator</li>
		<li>Putting yourself in the mind of the Creator to understand the purpose</li>
		<li><b>Archetypes: means that arise within the Creator as a function of self discovery,designed to articulate the question the Creator is asking itself</b></li>
		<li><i>We're the answer!</i></li>
		<li>By being imperfect and incompletely formed, we provide opportunities for self discovery</li>
		<li>You must let go of what you created, and then observe what it does and as / with what it returns</li>
		<li>Free will allows for maximal discovery of Creator</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>How are Kant's categories applied to free will and historical development?
	<ul>	<li>Understanding problem of freedom</li>
		<li>How do we understand who <i>we</i> are?</li>
		<li>Ways of understanding / predicting actions through <i>patterns</i></li>
		<li>Over time there will be tendencies towards certain categories of activity and development</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Archetypes are not tangible / provable
	<ul>	<li>Function as self-reflexive analysis of where you are on a particular issue (category)</li>
		<li>No right and wrong answer: not factual</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Example archetypal analysis: <b>Death</b>
	<ul>	<li><i>Transformation of the spirit</i></li>
		<li>"Dark night of the soul"
		<ul>	<li>Previous eagerness - making progress - elements in place</li>
			<li>But then a wall is hit</li>
			<li>Trying to "recapture magic"</li>
			<li>Work needed: initial enthusiasm not there</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Become a new person through your work
		<ul>	<li>Understanding needs to sink down into roots</li>
			<li>Old identity needs to be released or to "die"</li>
			<li>Figuring out where the old identity is "hooked in" and learning to trust the need for letting go of old patterns and energy / thought configurations</li>
			<li>You have to "own" the self you are now willing to let die (ergo, need for understanding)</li>
			<li>Once released, <i>who are you?</i>  Will you be anything (to self or otherselves)</li>
			<li>YOU ARE EXPOSED</li>
			<li><b>Faith</b> comes into play - trusting the process without knowing the outcome</li>	
			<li>Let go of all expectations about spiritual path you have been over</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li>Uniquely relevant in light of political and geological / astronomical changes</li>
		<li>We don't know where we're going</li>
		<li><b>Hope</b> within and with otherselves
		<ul>	<li>Basis of spiritual community</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
</li></ul></p>
<p>Now we're going through the question and answer phase.</p><p><div align=center><img src='pics/conference_17.jpg'/><br />From left to right: Paul Jacobs, Steven Tyman, Carla Rueckert, Maxine Pfefferkorn, Jim Pfefferkorn, Vara Lingklip</div></p>
