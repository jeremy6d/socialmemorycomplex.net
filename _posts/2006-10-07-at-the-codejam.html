I'm working on a <a href="http://mephistoblog.com/">Mephisto</a> implementation of the <a href="http://cvreg.org">CVREG.org website</a> right now.  It's slightly amusing to run into all the stupid problems you're bound to run into when you start a project but in a room full of other people doing the same thing.  You hear all the usual mutterings like "why won't you work?!?!?!" and "what the fuck is going on with this?!?!?!" and "oh, jeez, I'm an idiot!!!!"  But still: a lot of fun.

Hopefully, the next jam will be that much more productive.
