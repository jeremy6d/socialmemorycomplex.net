    Marat
    these cells of the inner self 
    are worse than the deepest stone dungeon 
    and as long as they are locked 
    all your revolution remains 
    only a prison mutiny 
    to be put down
    by corrupted fellow prisoners

The Persecution and Assassination of Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade, by Peter Weiss, Athenium. 1965
