For the following reasons:
<ol>
	<li>Unfortunately and to my own shame, I haven't yet worked out in my head whether or not I should change my policy towards voting, so I operated on the default setting.  That's my own fault for not resolving the dilemma in time.  Given that, there's obviously a lot of pressure to vote on the one day on which it's allowed.  I figured I'd be more regretful if I didn't vote and hated the outcome than if I voted and decided after the fact that I had just committed a crime against humanity.  Hopefully by the next election I will have either divorced myself from the need to participate, or I will have a more thorough, positively defined understanding of what I want to accomplish with my vote.</li>
	<li>I have never really considered, and nobody has convinced me, that voting is patently immoral in and of itself.  The ritual does not confer any real legitimacy on the regime, even though it appears that way.  It may give a wrong impression to the State and others, but it's not <em>wrong</em> per se.</li>
	<li>To really take a consistent stand against the State, I should not participate in ANY of its institutions.  That means surrendering my driver's license, not paying taxes, not obeying police officers, etc.  I'm not willing to do any of that... yet.  So voting is really not a big step in the direction of statism - nor is abstaining a big step in the other direction.  Like I said, I need to work out a consistent stand on this matter.</li>
</ol>
I did, however, turn down the "I voted" sticker... I wanted to tell the poll worker that I felt dirty.
