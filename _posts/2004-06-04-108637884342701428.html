As this blog comes together, I'd just like to thank Wil Forbis of <a href="http://www.acidlogic.com">Acid Logic</a> fame for getting me started at blogging.  I'm enjoying the experience immensely and am ripping the HTML from <a href="http://www.acidlogic.com/weblogs/blogger.htm">his own blog page</a>.  In fact, this blog will now be called My So Called Social Memory Complex.

Why are y'all groaning like that?

Anyway, my girlfriend, who is a full time, self employed potter, is doing another art show this weekend <a href="http://www.fredericksburg.va.us/prcontent.cfm?storyid=1">in Fredericksburg</a>.  This means I get to sit at a booth with her while women going through or already past menopause ask dumb questions and whine about how cute everything is without buying anything.  The worst ones are the ones who try to talk down your price, as if she really should be charging less for this stuff that she works her ass of at.  "Hello, this took a lot of time, it's only $15, just give her the money, take it out of the big sack of bills your husband got when he cashed in his stock options, you pretentious sack of botox!"  I swear, I have no idea how she does it.  I could never do any retail, I would just give myself an ulcer.
