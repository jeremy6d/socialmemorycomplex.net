Human errors while driving can be deadly, not just to the driver, but to pedestrians and other motorists as well.</p><p>We all have a responsibility to ensure that everybody on the road is safe.  So the next time you see somebody make a mistake, do everybody a favor and take their keys away.  You just might save a life.</p>
