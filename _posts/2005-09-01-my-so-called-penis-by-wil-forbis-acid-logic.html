<p><a href="http://www.acidlogic.com/weblogs/blogger.htm">Good point, Wil:</a><blockquote>You know, I've been baffled for two years at our inability to make any meaningful dent in rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure, but looking at our general impotence to do anything meaningful in regards to saving lives in New Orleans it's starting to make sense. Maybe there are good reasons for it - I suppose you can't just dump bales of water and food on people huddles in the Astro or SuperDome or whatever it's called without genuine fears of riots and hoarding. But I think like most people I'm overcome with a sense that this America in the year 2005 and the best we can do is pretty shitty.</blockquote><p>Follow the money, fellas... New Orleans is not Bush's pet project right now.</p>
