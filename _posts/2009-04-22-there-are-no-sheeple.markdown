title: There are no "sheeple"
excerpt: "Marcel Votlucka makes a crucial point about radical activists&#39; attitudes in a new article at Black Oak Media: &quot;...the very concept of &#39;sheeple&#39; is perilous because it evokes the kind of arrogance, contempt and deep-rooted fear the State has for free, motivated and empowered people. It brings radicals dangerously close to thinking along the same lines as hard-core Statists even as we attempt to offer an alternative way.&quot;"
