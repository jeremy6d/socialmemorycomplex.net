title: "Socialism: A Perfectly Good Word Rehabilitated"
excerpt: "Kevin Carson reexamines the term and sorts out the stigma. &quot;If anything, it\x92s the choice of \x93capitalism\x94 as the conventional term for a free market that needs explaining.  Why name an economic system based on free markets after one factor of production in particular, especially when even neoclassical orthodoxy regards capital as only one coequal factor among several?  The choice of terms, perhaps unwittingly, suggests a system in which the interests of capital have an especially privileged status; it may also suggest something about the sympathies of those who chose the term.&quot;"

The choice of terms, perhaps unwittingly, suggests a system in which the interests of capital have an especially privileged status; it may also suggest something about the sympathies of those who chose the term.&quot;
