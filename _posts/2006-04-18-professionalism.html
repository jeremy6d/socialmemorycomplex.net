<p><img src='http://images.ibsys.com/2006/0414/8699348_240X180.jpg' style="float:right;margin:3px;">Normally I try not to post mere links (more on this in a few days) but <a href="http://www.nbc10.com/news/8700511/detail.html">this</a> video is too funny.  I always hated it in school when law enforcement officers would come in and give some demeaning, patronizing presentation that completely insulted our intelligence.  I don't think all officers are by definition so coarse and unthoughtful, but certainly the ones that want to scare kids are.  I can respect* professional officers who do their job and serve honestly, despite what I may have claimed in anger in the past; I simply would like to see them come down as hard on their own when they do wrong as they come down on us when we "stray".</p><p>Now this officer featured in the video is <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0411061foot1.html">suing</a> for looking dumb on camera?  I just think this is great: you treat kids like idiots and you end up looking like an idiot - seems fair to me (it's officially too Gen X to mention the irony).  I just don't get this.  Of course, this officer is typical of the DEA, which likes to operate with an air of mystique while violating your liberties.</p><p>Notes:<ul><li>Hat tip to <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/HammerOfTruth?m=1427">Hammer of Truth</a></li><li>* Respect for an individual should not be confused with acknowledgement of legitimate authority.</li><li>In other news, I recently became involved with <a href="http://copwatch.org" title="Copwatch - Policing the Police">Copwatch</a>.  I'll be helping to redesign their site and get it ready for activist purposes.</li></ul></p>
