<p>Gary is one of my groomsmen and the chief administrator and planner of this seminar.  He just gave a very articulate and funny talk to kick off the seminar.  He even worked stuff about Star Wars into it.  Impressive - he was so nervous about it ahead of time and it went fine; well, even.</p><p>Now Carla Rueckert of <a href="http://www.llresearch.org">L/L Research</a> is now introducing the speakers.</p><p>Carla is now leading the meditation - I'll sign off...</p>
