<a href="http://praxeology.net/molinari.htm">The Molinari Insitute</a> has a fair amount of resources for individualist anarchists, and their new journal The Industrial Radical promises to be an excellent source for digesting anarchist writing by subject matter.
<blockquote>The title "Industrial Radical" honors the <a href="http://praxeology.net/anarcres.htm#heritage">libertarian and individualist anarchist thinkers and activists of the 19th century</a>, who were "industrial" in the sense of championing what they called the industrial mode of social organization, based on voluntary cooperation and mutual benefit, over the militant mode, based on hierarchy, regimentation, and violence; and who were "radical" in the sense of recognizing that social problems are embedded in sustaining networks of institutions and practices, and so can be addressed only via thoroughgoing social change.  Their approach informs our vision.</blockquote>
If you're interested in taking anarchism - the authentic free market - seriously, I urge you to support this journal and the institute.
