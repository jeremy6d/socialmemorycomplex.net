I thought this up on the car ride to Asheville, when I was trying to keep myself awake.
    
    And I'm cowed to be an American
    Where the drones are watching me
    And I won't forget the men who died
    In that no-knock raid last week
    And I'll gladly lay down on the ground
    With my arms behind my back
    'Cause there ain't no doubt that I'm under arrest
    God help the USA
