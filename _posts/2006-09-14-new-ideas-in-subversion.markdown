From Wil's blog, <a href="http://acidlogic.com/weblogs/blogger.htm">My So Called Penis</a> (still the best blog name ever):
<blockquote>You know what would be a great virus to spread to cell phones? A virus that goes into the phone and replaces people's ringtones with some guy yelling stuff like, "Hey fuckhead! I'm fucking ringing!" or "Hey douchebag, you gonna tell everyone you fucked your cat last night? That was pretty sick, fucko."

Preferably in a New Jersey accent.</blockquote>
