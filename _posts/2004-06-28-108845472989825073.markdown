Man, whoever said Fahrenheit 9/11 would never make money was a dummy.  I spent an hour and a half just trying to find a theater playing it in the Richmond area and once I found it, it was sold out for the rest of the day.

Well, Michael Moore and his fat ass are just gonna have to wait.  I'll try again on Thursday.

By the way, I have an interview on Friday with a company that programs slot machines.  I'm still trying to figure out whether this is one of those cases of cosmic irony.  It's complicated since I don't really have strong feelings one way or another about gambling, other than that it just bores me.  Man, that's gonna be so cool when I can go to a casino, hit up-up-down-B-A-B and get like totally paid.  Screw extra lives.
