Awesome.  It's good to have <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-01-17-wmd_x.htm">evidence</a> from a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,120535,00.html">disinterested</a> <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5040831/">source</a> when considering your <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5040831/">military options</a>.</p><p>Let's just post that up on <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/02/05/sprj.irq.powell.un/">Colin Powell</a>'s bulletin board, ok?  Yeah, right there next to the pictures of Iraqi <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/world/0302/gallery.powell.un/content.2.7.html">mobile weapons labs</a> and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/interactive/world/0302/gallery.powell.un/content.3.1.html">aluminium tubes</a>... great, thanks - I have a hard time reaching that high.</p><p>The length of the Bush Admin's reach, on the other hand, is yet to be determined.</p>
