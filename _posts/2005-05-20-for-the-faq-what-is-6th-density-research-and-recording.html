<p>I just realized that I've never really talked about my music on this blog (at least that I can remember, or at least for this incarnation of the blog in Wordpress).</p><p><a href="http://www.6thdensity.net">6th Density Research and Recording</a> is sort of an internet label that I'm trying to start in a half assed manner.  The goal is to find people who are interested in using electronic music to convey spiritual concepts in a more abstract form than simply composing lyrics.  Many spiritual traditions recognize vibration, including music, as a powerful force in the universe.  I'm just trying to find people who want to use the beats, breaks, and sounds of the emerging electronic culture to musically talk about the more subtle aspects of life and the coming shift into fourth density.  You can read more about the mission <a href="http://6thdensity.net/about.html">here</a>.  You can also find my music <a href="http://socialmemorycomplex.blogspot.com">here</a>.</p><p>Just thought it was wierd that I wasn't shoving my interests down y'all's throats.  Sorry 'bout that.</p>
