<blockquote>As many of you are likely already aware, President Bush will be coming to Richmond this week to help fund raise for Senator George Allen in his bid to hold his current Senate seat in the upcoming elections.  The Republican Party of Virginia's Web site indicates that the fund raiser will consist of a reception ($500) and photo op ($5000) with Bush and Allen at the Science Museum of Virginia on Thursday, October 19th.  Participants are required to arrive by 3:30 p.m., with the photo op at 4 p.m. and the reception at 4:30 p.m.

Bush's visit to our town (and in such a public venue) represents a rare opportunity to express our dissatisfaction with him, his war-mongering policies and those who support him.  The Richmond contingent of the Virginia Anti-War Network (VAWN), therefore, is planning a protest to coincide with this fund-raising event.  Details are given below.  Interest is strong.  Please plan to come out to show your opposition to this disgraceful administration and all that it represents.</blockquote>
The Science Museum of Virginia is at 2500 W. Broad St. Parking may be available at the adjacent DMV building. I'll probably try to park somewhere further away from the action. Let me know if you'll be there!
