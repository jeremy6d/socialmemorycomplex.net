title: A Rally to Address the Domestic Costs of Empire
excerpt: |-
  Who enables the massive governmental spending on violent policies? Which key organization promotes the growing concentration of power in corporations? What entity pumped out more free money for big banks and connected businesses than any other bank or country in the world?
  
  On March 19, 2009 the Richmond Left Libertarian Alliance invites you to participate in a demonstration that aims to tie our corporate militarism to the economic meltdown of the past months. We will assemble first at the Virginia Employment Commission at 4:30 PM to demonstrate solidarity with those suffering from the economic downturn. At 5:00 PM we will march to Kanawha Plaza (8th and Canal) to stage a protest against endless war and economic privilege right in front of the Richmond office that helps makes it all possible.
