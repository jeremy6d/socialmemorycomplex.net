Ehh, I get sick of Blogger's weak ass.  I've been moved for a while, but I didn't want to make it official until I had decided whether to import all my posts from Blogger to here.  I've now decided to just keep the Blogger archives separate and provide a link to the old blog.  There was a script that was supposed to move all the Haloscan comments over here, but it blows.  So I'll just keep everything the same for the Blogger archives.

Anyway, I'm taking today off to housesit for my fiance's parents.  Chillin'.
