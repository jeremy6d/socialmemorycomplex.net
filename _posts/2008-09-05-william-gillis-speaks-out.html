<p>I cover <a href="http://all-left.net">A.L.L.</a>y William Gillis's contribution to the RWC press conference at <a href="http://leftlibertarian.org/archives/4649">leftlibertarian.org</a>:</p><blockquote><p>William's willingness to personally speak out, not just against the brutal, self-destructive police state, but also as an unrepentant and bold advocate for anarchism at a time when adherents to that peaceful philosophy are being singled out as terrorists, is nothing short of heroic. We all owe William a debt of gratitude, for I've never felt more proud of my opposition to the criminals and serial sadists of the state as I did watching him speak.</p></blockquote>
