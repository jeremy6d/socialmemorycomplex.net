<p>Speaking of which, <a href="http://www.hbo.com/thewire/">The Wire</a> is, hands down, the best drama on television - ever.  I hope to write more about the series now that it has ended.  In the meantime, if you've never seen it, start at the beginning. It makes the counterinstitutionalist case better than I could ever hope to.</p>
