<a href="http://swacgirl.blogspot.com/2006/10/presidential-quotes.html">SWAC Girl</a> has a question for <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=551">us anti-war protestors</a>:
<blockquote>"We're ready, we're steady, we're resolved."
--President George W. Bush

"Stay strong for freedom."
--Senator George Allen

Wonder what part of these quotes anti-war protesters don't get?</blockquote>
I'll admit it: I don't get <em>any</em> part of it.  To me, the statements are completely empty.  They don't say anything at all.  It's not that they're wrong (though they may be - it's possible, indeed, that the President is "ready" for <em>something</em>); it's that they're meaningless.

Maybe she was just trying to be funny?  In which case, those statements are the political equivalent of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wHTg_LBVjw">a <em>Family Circus</em> comic</a>.
