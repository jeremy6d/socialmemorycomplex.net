OK.  Some of you may think from the past two posts that I do not like women or something like that.  That's not true at all!  "Proof," I hear you clamor.  "Proof, or we shall sacrifice you on the altar of Political Correctness!"  And, while I'm sure Bill Maher is a perfectly nice gentlemen (and funny as hell), he comes across a little too metro for my tastes, and he's certainly not the person with whom I want to spend my last moments before being thrown into a pit with of <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/sports_skanks/">rabid, jealous internet women</a> to kill me (God, I seriously cannot think of anything worse than a girl who's into professional sports - it's like the worst of both worlds!).

Basically, I'm announcing that I'm engaged to Tasha, my girlfriend of six years.  So there's that.  We're getting married in late September.  So, see, I don't hate *all* women.

Yet.

And if you didn't know this already, that's a pretty good indication that you don't talk to me enough.  Yeah, I said it.
