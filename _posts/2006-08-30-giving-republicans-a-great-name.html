I stopped reading RTG because of stuff like <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com/2006/08/30/cindy-sheehan-will-dance-to-anything/">this</a> (among other reasons):
<blockquote>But seriously, how stupid do you have to be to hold this ridiculous â€˜march on Democracy' right as the country is tensing up to commemorate 9/11?</blockquote>
Heh.  I guess it's something that RTG says the things Republican / neoconservative types are content with merely insinuating in an ever so subtle manner:
<ol>
	<li>Hands off - Republicans own 9/11.  Democrats should stop complaining and get their own national tragedy to use.  Here's a helpful suggeston for liberals: work on getting elected on a similar disasterous foreign policy platform so that a tragedy of comparable magnitude can be created on the Democrat watch (something tells me this is somewhere in Lieberman's 2004 platform).</li>
	<li>9/11 means the end of democracy - whether we're marching about it or, ya know, holding elected officials to the Constitution.  Don't people get that?!?!</li>
	<li>The public is a wounded lamb in need of tender, Republican cooing and firm assurances that "we'll get those mean boys who did this to you!"  (Imagine how "tense" I would be if it weren't for Bush's wars against teh 9/11!)</li>
</ol>
It's nice to have honesty for once.  But I guess I could get honesty by reading <em>Mein Kampf</em> as well.  Even her analysis of the Enron debacle started off interesting - yet it quickly degraded into hero-worship of the American CEO as the phallus from which all life gushes forth.  Par for the course, I suppose.

Why?  Because we've gotta get that lava-hot blood running to the head.  That's politics.  Cindy Sheehan dancing - that's politics for her.  Bush's foreign policy is secondary to maintaining a conservative version of Us magazine and clucking about what so-and-so is doing now - "those craaaaaaazy liberals - what'll they do next?!?!"

I do miss having such an obvious wingnut to wail on, but I really need to clean her contemptible blog off of my OPML just because, ya know, my eyes deserve better.  Ugh, good riddance.  (Wonder when I'm going to be denounced for "stealing" her sentence I quoted)
