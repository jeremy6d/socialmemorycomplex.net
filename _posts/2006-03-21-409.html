<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/WThomasSmithJr/2006/03/20/190322.html">This essay</a> by W. Thomas Smith, Jr. shows just how screwed up the priorities of the warmongers are:<blockquote><p>As I mentioned in my piece on irresponsible reporting, there is far too much emphasis on blatantly inflammatory words and pictures â€“ any opportunity to focus attention on tired stories like Abu Ghraib or an angry politician's loaded comments about "no WMDs" or an "impending civil war."</p><p>Thanks to the short shrift given it by many members of the mainstream press, too few Americans appreciate or grasp the magnitude of the fact that the first session (since last December) of a freely elected Iraqi parliament convened on March 16: A result that would not have been possible had it not been for three risky albeit remarkably successful elections since January 2005.</p></blockquote>It just made me crack up when I read it.  The entire basis of the war - WMDs - were proven phony.  Our troops were caught torturing helpless prisoners.  The country we "benevolently invaded" is on the verge of a complete meltdown.  But, no, forget all that, America - Smith thinks you should concentrate on the fact that, in some far off corner of the globe, a group of elite middle easterners are sitting around a table discussing politics.</p><p>I think what we're witnessing here is a total implosion of legitimacy on the part of the conservative movement.  But I'd enjoy it more if it wasn't putting American lives at risk.</p>
