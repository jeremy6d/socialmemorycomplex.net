I've posted pictures from our party last weekend on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jeremy6d">my flickr account</a>.

This picture shows me reassuring the crowd that my first attempt at grilling hamburgers was not going to blow them up.  However, I was worried I would.  Grease was dripping from the the grill into the grease catcher, and flames were trickling down near the propane tank.  Luckily, my friend Donnie kept his cool and showed me how to work the grill.
