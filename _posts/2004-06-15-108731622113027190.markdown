Anybody wanna quick laugh?  Go <a href="http://www.moveamericaforward.org">here</a> and bring your mini plastic flag.  Damn, people are dumb.

Why are people dumb?  Well, I think like every other problem in the world it has to do with identity.  People who are ueberpatriotic have their very identity so tied into the country and America being so "great" that they have to believe it can do no wrong.  This is what dictatorial power structures do - they make you believe that you ARE the state, that the state's success is your success.  It's not a sacrifice if you believe that the sacrifice furthers your interest.  So the way you get people to sacrifice their wealth, safety, and rights is by making them think that the state's interests are their interests (basically, fascism).  False authorities lead to false identities.  It's not that people are evil so much as people have issues; mental blockages that prevent them from seeing the whole picture.

Once again, I'd like to plug <a href="http://www.blackalicious.com">The Gift of Gab</a> and his beautiful new solo album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000189X4A/qid=1087315737/sr=8-1/ref=__1/102-4941199-5678505?v=glance&amp;s=music">4th Dimensional Rocketships Going Up</a>.  Check this shit out:
<blockquote>See I know they don't tell us that we really are gods
Dwelling in infinity through the power of now
I spread the good karma out, grab a pen and a sheet,
And empty out my mind so the ancestors can speak through me,
I'm tweaked to beats, rock, eat the beats up
Dwelling in the fourth dimension of spirit and going up, and it
Can't stop, don't stop, won't stop, ain't gonna
Stop, aim from the top, straight blowin' up</blockquote>

It's never been cooler to spew that <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=greenlantern113&amp;comment=108722758304769382#8049">hippy new age drivel</a>!
