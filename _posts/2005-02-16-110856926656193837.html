On the front page of <a href="http://drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a>: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/sci_nat_how_the_world_is_changing/html/1.stm">Photographic Evidence of Global Warming</a>:

Pretty  undeniable.  However, there's a lot of holes in the theory that this is all somehow man's fault.  For example, the evidence shows that the heating of the oceans is occuring <a href="">from the ocean floor up</a>.

<br />In fact, <a href="http://www.ascension2000.com/">David Wilcock</a> has gathered a lot of evidence to show that <a href="http://www.enterprisemission.com/_articles/05-14-2004/Interplanetary_1.htm">climate change is occuring throughout our solar system</a>, and that the engine of such change is larger than any force we have yet imagined.
<br />Food for thought.  Mmmmmm, thought.
