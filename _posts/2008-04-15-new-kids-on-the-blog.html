<p>Since I've been hanging out on <a href="http://essembly.com">essembly</a>, a political social networking site, I've benefited from discussions with many bright members.  So I was delighted to see that two of the sharpest libertarian socialists on there have started blogs: <a href="http://www.silent-radical.blogspot.com/">Slient Radical</a> and <a href="http://belinskyonpolitics.blogspot.com/">Belinsky on Politics</a>.  I hope they find blogging to be conducive to their explorations of anarchism, but I'm very sure that the rest of us will benefit greatly from their insights.</p>
