Radley Balko pretty much sums up my feelings on this case:
<blockquote><span class="extras">I'm not about to stick up for a witch-hunt prosecution of a guy who seems to have been convicted of misremembering from whom he heard something, based on evidence that essentially consists of what other people did or didn't remember. Even if I don't happen to like the guy who's just been convicted. It strikes me as quite similar to the Martha Stewart case -- the defendant was convicted of lying during the course of an investigation of a crime that prosecutors could never prove was actually committed. All of us ought to find that troubling.</span>

President Bush's use of the pardon power to this point has generally been to exonerate people for crimes committed decades ago -- crimes they've admitted to and have repented for. He <em>hasn't</em> used it f<a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=5217">or the reasons it was intended</a> -- as a final check on real injustices that may have slipped through the system. If Bush suddenly decides to use the pardon power to correct a prosecutorial overreach only on the occasion when the person being prosecuted is a formerly high-ranking official in his administration, his critics have every reason to cry foul.</blockquote>
Amen.  These episodic scandals are distractions from the real political issues.  We shouldn't expect consistency in this particular case where we haven't decried its absence elsewhere.
