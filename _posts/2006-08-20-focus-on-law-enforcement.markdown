<a href="http://theagitator.com">Radley Balko</a> has posted some great <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> videos related to law enforcement lately which I think merit sharing (in lieu of actual original writing on my part - yes, America, I'm in another blogging funk).
<ul>
	<li>L.E.A.P. (Law Enforcement Against Prohibition) created <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LayaGk0TMDc">a video</a> of former police officers presenting their case against the drug war.Â  It's always reassuring to see the authorities talking common sense (for once).</li>
	<li>Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Slaw1tYDPFc">a video</a> of cops firing rubber bullets at unarmed, non-threatening people and then laughing about it.</li>
	<li>Here's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p53ky3RIjfU">a video</a> of cops arresting somebody simply for asking for a officer complaint form.</li>
</ul>
Yay, America.
