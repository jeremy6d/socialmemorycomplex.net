  ## History ##
  Social Memory Complex started in 2004 as a site for an eponymous musical project. Inspired by the hilarious serial writing of Wil Forbis at [Acid Logic](http://www.acidlogic.com), I launched the blog in June of 2004 to explore blogging as an expressive form in its own right. I had been a frequent commenter on forums and blogs, and [my experiment](http://socialmemorycomplex.net/features/history-as-the-evolution-of-identity.html) with writing standalone essays led me to attempt blogging in my own right.

  I started this blog on Blogger (that's where all the untitled posts are from) and moved to a Wordpress install hosted by my old friend, [Matt Walters](http://mattwalters.net). That provided the technical experience I needed to obtain my own hosting when it became necessary. Now I've moved from Wordpress to a Ruby-based platform called [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

  The topics on this blog have changed over the near decade I've spent writing on my own platform. It started out geared primarily towards humor and political asides. Over time I'd like to think I've found a voice, and the blog has followed several dimensions of growth: my trajectory from libertarianism to anarchism, from rights-based politics to a more quasi-egoist variety, and from shittier programming languages and methodologies to behavior driven development and ruby. It's been a wild ride, and I appreciate everybody who has been a part of the conversations that challenged me to grow.

  I don't like stifling people's voices, so no moderation on the comments except for spam. I will never show ads on the site. If you want to support me, pay me to write a feature, either in English or a programming language.
