<p>Clients frequently like to keep applications under development behind some kind of basic authentication.  Apache makes this easy, but mod_proxy_balancer complicates things slightly.  While you normally put your AllowOverride, AuthType, etc. directives under the correct Directory definition, if you try doing this alone with a Rails app running on a mongrel cluster, you'll see it doesn't work.  Instead, you'll get an authentication dialog for each resource on the page (stylesheet, pictures, etc.) and it will <em>still</em> allow you through to the code!  Probably has something to do with the URL rewriting going on to make the cluster proxying possible (which doesn't happen in the Directory clause).</p><p>The solution was found <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-deployment/browse_thread/thread/8ddedcfd45146ee0?fwc=1">here</a>: put your authentication directives in the proxy definition itself:<blockquote><p><code>&lt;Proxy balancer://my_awesome_cluster&gt;
 BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:9000
 BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:9001
 BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:9002
 BalancerMember http://127.0.0.1:9003
 AllowOverride AuthConfig
 AuthType Basic
 AuthName "Top Secret, biotch"
 AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/authorized_users.passwd
 Require valid-user
&lt;/Proxy&gt;</code></p></blockquote><p>That'll put the kibosh on broke ass mahfuckahz.  Hope this helps somebody.</p>
