title: Reaching Out to the Left
excerpt: Anthony Gregory discusses ways in which libertarians can appeal to leftists to make common cause against the state. &quot;Many people are on the political Left, and such people tend to be interested in activism and ideas and are especially valuable to the cause of liberty when they finally come around and embrace the consistent libertarian program. Ignoring them is not an option, and belittling them is not a luxury we can afford.&quot;
