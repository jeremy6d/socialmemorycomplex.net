<a href="http://bradspangler.com">Brad</a> <a href="http://www.bradspangler.com/blog/archives/436">tagged me</a> with the Viral Book Questionaire.  I usually don't respond to this kind of intimidation, but I'm sure Brad had his reasons.  Anyway, it makes me realize that I need to read more... at least more things published on paper.
<ul>
	<li><strong>One book that changed your life.</strong>
I'd say it's a toss up between <a href="http://acim.org">A Course In Miracles</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767900391/103-0219264-0529472?v=glance&n=283155">What it Means to be a Libertarian</a> by Charles Murray.  Each book made me see things in a radically different light, even though I'm not a huge fan of either any longer.  I guess that's what it means to be growing intellectually.</li>
	<li><strong>One book that you have read more than once.</strong>
<a href="http://llresearch.org/library/the_law_of_one_pdf/the_law_of_one_pdf.htm">The Law of One series</a> published by <a href="http://llresearch.org">L/L Research</a>.  Probably read the series all the way through about five times, and learn something new each time.</li>
	<li><strong>One book that you would want on a desert island.</strong>
Hmm... I would think I'd want something I hadn't read before, but if I had to pick something I've already read... probably Kurt Vonnegut's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/038533348X/sr=8-1/qid=1154994500/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0219264-0529472?ie=UTF8">Cat's Cradle</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>One book that made you laugh.</strong>
That's a tough one... probably some David Sedaris book I read.  Of course we're speaking of proper literature here, not things like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446532681/sr=8-2/qid=1154995477/ref=pd_bbs_2/103-0219264-0529472?ie=UTF8">America</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>One book that made you cry.</strong>
I think Heinlein's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441790348/sr=8-1/qid=1154995375/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0219264-0529472?ie=UTF8">Stranger in a Strange Land</a> might have evoked a tear... but again I'm not sure.  I'm pretty sure the end of the Lord of the Rings trilogy was emotional for me the first time I read it.</li>
	<li><strong>One book you wish had been written.</strong>
Oh, that's easy: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440539811/sr=8-1/qid=1154994782/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0219264-0529472?ie=UTF8">The Illuminatus! Trilogy</a> by R.A. Wilson and Robert Shea.  A brilliant and perfectly executed look at conspiracy theory.</li>
	<li><strong>One book you wish had never been written.</strong>
I find this question a bit distasteful... probably Chicken Soup for the Soul.  How vapid.</li>
	<li><strong>One book you are currently reading.</strong>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195189779/sr=8-1/qid=1154994621/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0219264-0529472?ie=UTF8">The Undercover Economist</a> by Tim Hartford</li>
	<li><strong>One book you have been meaning to read.</strong>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/store/Human-Action-The-Scholars-Edition-P119C17.aspx">Human Action</a> by Ludwig von Mises</li>
