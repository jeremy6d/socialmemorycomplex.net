<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._Smith">George H. Smith</a> gives <a href="http://ronpaul2008.com">Ron Paul</a> a quasi-endorsement:</p><p align=center><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/h81tGuWCdmY&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/h81tGuWCdmY&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p><p>But of course, <em>every</em> endorsement is conditional, to the extent that it is principled and thought-out.  But this is precisely why I do appreciate Smith making his stance clear, instead of just issuing blanket moral indictments of people.  Institutions matter, true, but <em>people act</em>, not institutions.  Libertarians should be talking about this, rather than using this as an excuse to excommunicate each other.</p>
