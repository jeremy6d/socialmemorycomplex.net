<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/06/08/eveningnews/main621856.shtml">More evidence of what happens when big business gives big government sexual gratification.</a>  Check out the shit Enron was trying to pull on Cali:

<blockquote>One employee is heard asking, "You want to do some fat boys or, or whatever, man, you know, take advantage of it."</blockquote>
Disgusting.  Energy consumers, take notice - your young obese men are not safe in Enron's hands.

What's really disturbing is what <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=282&amp;row=1">Arnold Schwarzenegger did about the Enron scandal</a>:

<blockquote>The wannabe governor has yet to deny that on May 17, 2001, at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles, he had consensual political intercourse with Enron chieftain Kenneth Lay.  Also frolicking with Arnold and Ken was convicted stock swindler Mike Milken.</blockquote>

Eww!
