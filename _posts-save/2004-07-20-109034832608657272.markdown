Well lots of stuff happened since Wednesday.&nbsp; First of all, I did decide to go to Raleigh, but a big ass storm hit my town.&nbsp; Has to be the worse thunderstorm I've ever seen.&nbsp; Lightning struck a house and burnt it to the ground about a mile away from&nbsp;me.&nbsp; I was tired but decided to go to Raleigh anyway, so I waited for the storm to subside.&nbsp; Anyway, 10 miles down the road I got pulled over for reckless driving.&nbsp; So now I have to go to court.&nbsp; Turned around and went home.
&nbsp;
Anyway, Friday I went down to Virginia Beach to see <a href="http://www.brotherspast.com/">Brothers Past</a> and the show was awesome and I saw a lot of people I know and met a lot I didn't.&nbsp; A guy from that INTJ list I joined also came out on my invitation, which was cool.&nbsp; After the show they were partying all night at the hotel and I got no sleep till I sucked it up and drove back home at 6am.&nbsp; Slept all day and went to the show in Richmond, which was again awesome.&nbsp; Ran into a bunch of Richmond kids I hadn't seen in a while, including some that I used to play in a band with.&nbsp; So that was cool.&nbsp; But, again, I partied too late and didn't get any sleep till I drove home at 6AM.&nbsp; Starting to see a pattern here?&nbsp; :-)
&nbsp;
We might go backpacking this weekend with some friends.&nbsp; I've been fiending to go for some time.&nbsp; That's all I can type now because I'm still recovering from this weekend.
