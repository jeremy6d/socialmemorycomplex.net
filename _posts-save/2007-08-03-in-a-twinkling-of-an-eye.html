<p>Looking back at the beginning of this week, I marvel at the relatively secure position in life I enjoyed - content but static.  There wasn't much on the horizon to indicate that I would be making any giant strides forward, but I could comfortably tread water indefinitely.</p><p>Now at the end of the week, the world has turned upside down.  I'm suddenly unemployed, the future is wide open, and I'm more excited and energized about life than I've been in years.  I found a freelance gig within hours of being laid off that couldn't have been more tailored to my situation, and beyond that I have the freedom to head in any direction I choose.</p><p>Life's weird... and wonderful.</p>
