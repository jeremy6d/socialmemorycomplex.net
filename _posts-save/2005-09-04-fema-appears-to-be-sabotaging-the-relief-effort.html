<p>From AntiWar.com: <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/blog/comments.php?id=P2344_0_1_0">The Cavalry can't get past FEMA</a>!  They are turning away truckloads and tankerloads of fuel, water, and supplies.  They are cutting communications lines!  What is going on?!?!?!</p><p>Isn't there a line in the Declaration of Independence that reads:<blockquote>...whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, security, etc.), it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it...</blockquote><p>Goddamn it I'm no alarmist but frankly at this point I'm not entirely convinced we wouldn't be better off with FEMA getting out of the way completely.  The whole situation approaches purposeful sabotage and reminds me of all the right wing nuts who used to claim that FEMA was preparing to institute a national coup.</p>
