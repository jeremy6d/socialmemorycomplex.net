I'm really enjoying Larry David's <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm</em> on DVD.  I know I'm like 5 years behind (I didn't start watching Seinfeld till Season 6 or 7) but there's something about not being plugged into popular culture that makes me feel cool.  I think that thing is called "hopeless delusion".

I like how Richard Lewis is always in the episodes.  I don't really think he's that funny, but he reminds me of a childhood friend named Richard Lewis.  Seriously.  I had a friend in 5th grade who, thinking back on it, reminds me of Richard Lewis.  Except, well, I think my friend turned out to be gay.

Does anybody else besides me think Aqua Teen Hunger Force is overrated?  I get a few laughs out of it, but... I want more Carl.

OK, that's the popular culture post for the year.  Back to plugging no-name bands like <a href="http://www.bpradio.net">Brothers Past</a> and <a href="http://www.lotusvibes.com">Lotus</a>.  

You see how I just did that?  Yee-uh, bitch.
