<p><img style="margin-right: 1em; float: left;" id="image758" src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/UOCD01.jpg' alt="Uncle Tupelo's Anodyne" />If you've never really listened to Uncle Tupelo's <u>Anodyne</u>, you need to.  Everytime I listen to it I marvel at the fact that something this authentic and intense could possibly be made in this day and age.  I'm just thankful that Tweedy and Farrar could hold it together long enough to see this done.  I can't think of many hardships that wouldn't have been worth enduring to make this wonderful piece of art take shape in the physical world.</p>
