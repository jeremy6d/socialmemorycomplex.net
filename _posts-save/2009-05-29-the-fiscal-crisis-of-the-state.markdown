excerpt: "&quot;I\x92m reminded of James O\x92Connor\x92s The Fiscal Crisis of the State, written in 1973. \n\
  State spending in a capitalist society, he said, must fulfil two functions: to raise profits, for example by maintaining aggregate demand; and to legitimate the system by ameliorating inequalities. But, he said, these forces for higher spending increased faster than people\x92s willingness to pay tax. The upshot was a tendency to bigger budget deficits, even in decent economic times.&quot;"

&quot;I'm reminded of James O'Connor's The Fiscal Crisis of the State, written in 1973.

But, he said, these forces for higher spending increased faster than people's willingness to pay tax. The upshot was a tendency to bigger budget deficits, even in decent economic times.&quot;
