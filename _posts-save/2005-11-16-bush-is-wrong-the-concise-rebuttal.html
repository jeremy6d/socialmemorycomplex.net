<p>Just thought <a href="http://lawandpolitics.blogspot.com/">this</a> was a very short and clear statement of the problems with the Bush administration's use of intelligence to justify the Iraq war:<blockquote><p>I've said this before, but it's worth re-emphasizing in light of Bush's speech. The argument of critics is not that Bush mistakenly thought that Iraq had WMDs. A lot of people thought that - and that was a reasonable assumption. <b>The argument is that the administration made <i>specific</i> exaggerations about <i>specific</i> pieces of intelligence.</b> In doing so, it misled the American people. That's the real issue and what Bush said today is irrelevant to it.</p></blockquote><p>So let's stop <a href="http://rhog.blogspot.com/2005/11/so-saddam-had-wmds-after-all.html">obfuscating the issue</a> and <a href="http://rhog.blogspot.com/2005/11/bush-escalates-war-on-back-stabbers.html">setting up straw men</a> and get to the bottom of what happened, instead of focusing on how hypocritical Democratic politicians are - gee, thanks for the news flash, Bush.</p><p>(Just as an aside, I should add that even if the administration was not deceptive in their claims, I would still hold them accountable for making an error.  The stakes in war are too high for errors - even honest ones - to go unpunished.  However, Democrats don't want that standard applied to them when the tables are turned, so I can see why they avoid that argument.)</p>
