<p>I know <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt</a> didn't mean it like this when he <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=51#comment-285">said it</a>, but I would like to publicly thank him for hosting my blog, <a href="http://www.6thdensity.net">6th Density Research and Recording</a>, and my professional website (<a href="http://6thdensity.net/contact.html">contact me</a> if you're <i>really</i> interested in a link, I try to keep my professional name out of this blog because, well, I use words like "poop").  He has been very gracious and generous and helpful in my crazy adventure on the internet, and I just wanted to give him a shout out and say, "Hey!" and, "I really don't want to see Star Wars again with you!"</p><p>But I probably will.  :-)</p>
