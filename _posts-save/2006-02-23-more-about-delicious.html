<p>I've been using <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> quite a bit recently: to <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=398">create a linkblog</a>, to <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d">bookmark categorize sites</a>, and even to create a queue of articles to <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d/toread">read</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d/toblog">blog about</a>, and <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d/toexplore">explore more in depth</a>.  So if you don't understand how del.icio.us works (and you're sufficiently shamed into wanting to learn), here's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del.icio.us">a Wikipedia entry about del.icio.us</a>.  Social internet services like this are the wave of the future, and you might as well educate yourself now, since I'm typically the last to catch on to the bleeding edge stuff before AOL buys it and makes it into a commodity.</p>
