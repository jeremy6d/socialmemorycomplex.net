<p>This past weekend, two fellow market anarchists, a non-partisan, and I headed to some wilderness out in the mountains of Virginia.  Our mission: engage in discussion on anarchism (with particular emphasis on Carson's mutualist arguments), hike to another mountain to get a cool view of the area, and discharge a variety of firearms. Here is a report on our experiences:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hiking to the top of a mountain with thousands of feet in elevation change for almost 5 miles is not a task lightly assumed.  Bushwacking it is even more perilous.  There were many times where we proceeded on our bellies, the brush was so thick.  Ezra and I turned back before reaching the summit but we still got a good view.  Jim and Brady made the summit, so kudos to them.</li>
	<li>I tried out a variety of weapons, and I've decided that the .40 H&K USP is the handgun for me.  I had never shot one that big but it wasn't a big deal after all.</li>
	<li>Our discussions of anarchism hinged on a few topics:<br /><ol><li>How would a mutual bank operate, and would it work?</li><li>Is there such a thing as a "natural elite" as Hoppe talks about?</li><li>Is capitalism a fancy word for entrepreneurship, or are they distinct concepts?  How important is the distinction?</li></ol></li></ul><p>Of course, we discussed and did a lot more, but those are the highlights.  No visitors except for two locals who rolled by while we were breaking camp.  Walking around the mountain, we did run into a lot of other property owners, but they all seemed pretty friendly and generous.  I definitely want to buy some land in the mountains so I have somewhere to go and be alone - I love the outdoors and camping, but doing it on private land where you answer to nobody is a totally different experience.</p><p>Anyway, the weekend was a magnificent success, and we ate lots of bacon and sausage and probably STILL lost weight.  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.  Oh, and the camp we established is now officially named Camp Defiance. Many, many heartfelt thanks to Brady for extending the invitation to me - I had a great time!</p>
