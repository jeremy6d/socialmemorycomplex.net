I love these five albums.  In no particular order.  This is not a favorites list (I can't do that, I'm too wishy washy) or a "these are the best albums evah" list.  I'm just acknowledging these great works of art:
<ol>
	<li>Anodyne by Uncle Tupelo</li>
	<li>The Soft Bulletin by the Flaming Lips</li>
	<li>Rift by Phish</li>
	<li>The Life Pursuit by Belle and Sebastian</li>
	<li>Deltron 3030 by Dan the Automator, Del the Funkee Homosapien, and Kid Koala (among others)</li>
</ol>
I thought it would be cool to just take five minutes and list five albums that I remember and that mean a lot to me.  This ain't no tagging spree, but I'd be interested in your answers.  Like I said, this isn't about the best albums or your favorite, but something in between that.

Oh, remind me to review <a href="http://www.neonbible.com/">the new Arcade Fire</a> soon.  And the new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-Son-Volt/dp/B000MNOXXA/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-9734282-1283007?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1174415337&sr=1-1">Son Volt</a>.
