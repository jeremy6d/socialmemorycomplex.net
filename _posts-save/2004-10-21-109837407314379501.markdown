Wow, an article on Fox News that I can stand!  Radley Balko has given us <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,136114,00.html">the most concise and comprehensive argument against Bush and Kerry</a> that I have seen.<blockquote>Like most "small L" libertarians, I'd like to see a constitutionally limited government, a humble but formidable foreign policy, unfettered free markets, and a premium on personal freedom. 

Which is why I tend to get despondent around Election Day, and am again this year stuck with the classic "lesser of two evils" dilemma. The problem is that it's getting more and more difficult to discern which "evil" is lesser.</blockquote>Not that I like Fox News now, but at least somebody is trying to appeal to the libertarians.  I'm just sorta troubled that even the major media outlets are conceding that, yes, America is screwed.
