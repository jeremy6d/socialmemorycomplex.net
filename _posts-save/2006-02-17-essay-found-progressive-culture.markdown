I published an essay on the political and sociological implications of the <a href="http://wiki.lawof1.org">Law of One</a> back in April of 2004.  The essay was intended to be an introduction to <a href="http://bring4th.org">Bring4th</a>, a site that was newly launched at the time for spiritual activism and discussion.  Since then that site was hacked to hell, crashed, and burned.  I have been involved with relaunching it, but in the midst of all the hackery my essay was lost.  I've since found it and am republishing it <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?page_id=390">here</a>.  I'd be interested in any feedback on this.

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Another synchronicity among several this past month! <a href="http://www.oriononline.org">Orion Magazine</a> has an article about politics and spirituality as well, and it dovetails well with mine (though their politics are a bit more socialist than mine). But the writer's key point - that politics is the <em>opposite</em> of love - is a great way of saying what I've been trying to say for a while now.
By the way, I realize that many readers may not know what the hell the Law of One is.  I plan on writing a post on my approach to the Law of One from a beginner point of view.  This is preparation for a monthly meeting club on metphysics, spirituality, culture, art, history, and other stuff my friend Bill and I are starting in the Richmond area.  I think the tentative title of our club is Progressive Culture Richmond.

The idea is that we do some yoga and meditation, and each meeting a member gives a presentation on something he or she believes in.  So one meeting Bill would do a yoga presentation, one meeting another member would do another, and I'm planning on doing a presentation on the Law of One.  There's also a roundtable where everybody brings up a book, CD, movie, or something that they're basically digging and want to share with the group.  It's a way to ground our beliefs in sort a social setting, and I think the idea is powerful.
