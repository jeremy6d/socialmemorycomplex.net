Just started a new project at work, and it looks pretty intense.  I may not be blogging as regularly.  I'll try and write on the weekends at the very least.

On the upside, this will give me a great first hand look at organizational behavior in business.  I don't plan on drawing any immediate conclusions, but in particular I'm interested in the problems of large scale, centralized business operations.  I'm hoping that this will give me a fair glimpse into a dynamic and powerful market player from which I can draw conclusions in the future.  But in addition to on the job experience I want to consult some literature on the subject in order to better articulate the mechanisms in play.
