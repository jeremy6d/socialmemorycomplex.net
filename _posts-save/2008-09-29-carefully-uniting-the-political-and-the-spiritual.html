<p>My essay on the political implications of the <a href="http://lawofone.info">Law of One</a> is now <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?page_id=1131">up</a>.  Note that it may at times make zero sense if you aren't familiar with the Law of One material, but I plan on writing up a primer on the subject due to <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1041#comment-96609">popular</a> <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=1041#comment-96613">interest</a>. This essay is based on a talk I gave at <a href="http://llresearch.org/homecomings/homecoming_2008/homecoming_2008.aspx">this year's L/L Research Homecoming</a>, and it is in many ways the culmination of the project I set out on <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?p=205">in starting this blog</a>.</p>
