<p>Holy shit, did any of you honestly know this was going on right now?  I mean, while over 60 thousand foreclosures is a pretty big number, perhaps it's not cause for a total panic.  But I think confidence in the economy would plummet utterly if people actually knew what was going on right now.  I found this via <a href="http://distributism.blogspot.com/2008/03/its-not-just-for-drummers.html">John MÃ©daille</a> and it is pretty grim:</p><p><div align=center><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/CnnOOo6tRs8&hl=en"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/CnnOOo6tRs8&hl=en" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></div></p><p>Maybe I am just another guy with his head in the sand, I dunno.  But I honestly did not know that there were <em>camps</em> of these evicted people cropping up.  I think this economy is going to get worse before it gets better, and it's just a matter of time until people realize that.  And it's not going to be pretty when they do.</p>
