I know a lot of people have argued to me that instead of ripping on Libertarian Girl every chance I get, I should instead ignore her.  That way I limit the damage she does to the libertarian movement.  But the goal of this blog is to be interesting, not a policy vehicle for the <a href="http://www.lp.org">LP</a>.  So check out this <a href="http://libertariangirl.blogspot.com/2005/01/school-administrator-was-drug-money.html">gem of racism</a>.

The comment section of this post will serve as a sign-up sheet for those of you who are interested in starting an Anti Libertarian Girl Webring.  Or maybe we could just egg her or something.  I'm open to suggestions.
