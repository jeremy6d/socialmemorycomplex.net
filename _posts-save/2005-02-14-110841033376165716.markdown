Finally, I am vindicated!!!  <a href="http://libertariangirl.typepad.com/my_weblog/2005/02/if_it_werent_fo.html">Libertarian Girl is a fake!</a>  Thanks to <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/2005/02/hot-libertarian-girl-is-russian.html">X</a> and <a href="http://hammeroftruth.com/2005/02/14/libertarian-girl-exposed-fake-fake-fake/">Hammer of Truth</a>.

All is right with the world again... a world where <a href="http://jacquelinepassey.blogs.com/blog/">significantly less slutty, more intelligent, and far more attractive women</a> carry the banner for the libertarian movement (something about that "bookish" look).  And, let's face it - the truly hot chicks will always be gun-confiscating, affirmative-action-spouting, single-payer-health-system-lovin', pro-choicers.  And this is coming from a devout libertarian who is marrying a pretty liberal artsy girl in a matter months.  Something about socialism just turns me on!  I'm like the anti-Howard Roark.
