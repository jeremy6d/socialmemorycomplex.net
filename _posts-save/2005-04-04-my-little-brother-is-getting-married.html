<p>Saturday is the big day.  I'm kind of excited - he's been in the Army for the past 2 or 3 years, and I'll get to meet a bunch of his buddies from there, where he's been having a life completely apart from ours in Virginia.  Part of me thinks he just wants to beat Tasha and I to the altar, but... that just doesn't sound like his bag.  He's been dating his girl, Nicole, about as long as I've been with Tasha.  It's just kind of wierd.</p><p>Tasha and I went shopping for their gifts yesterday - they're registered at Linens-n-Things.  Shopping for registry stuff is cool - I think everybody should register for gifts, so you'd know what to get your wife for Christmas and stuff.  I just wish it was easier to find the stuff.  I kept having to double check the UPCs to make sure I was getting the EXACT item Nicole and John wanted.</p><p>Welp, I'm going home.  Maybe a little <a href="http://www.google.com/reviews?cid=b4ec6595da3fa7c5&oi=showtimes&fq=sin+city">Sin City</a>?  I've heard good things - and I trust <a href="http://www.sarwark.org/writings/2005/03/sin-city.html">X's opinion</a> almost always.</p>
