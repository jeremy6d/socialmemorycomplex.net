If you want to vote against Bush, but don't want to support Comrade Kerry, vote libertarian!  <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/21/politics/main619019.shtml">CBS news says it's ok</a>!  I would be totally cool with siphoning votes off of Bush so that Kerry gets in, because then the Republican party would be forced to realize that they can't talk the talk and not walk the walk of small government.  Plus, for all the talk about Nader spoiling Kerry's chances, I haven't heard of ONE person, even a Green, who has said they'd vote for him.  I've heard LOTS of people, mostly disenchanted Republicans, who say they'd vote for the <a href="http://www.badnarik.org">Libertarian candidate</a>.  There is reason to hope, fellas.
