Via <a href="http://www.againstmonopoly.org/index.php?perm=886089000000000548">Against Monopoly</a>, here's a great look at <a href="http://www.house.gov/pelosi/press/releases/Oct06/IntellectualPropertyAbuses.html">where Democrats' priorities are</a>:
<blockquote>We are writing you seeking immediate and effective action to promote and safeguard American intellectual property around the world. Goods and services produced by American workers, <strong>farmers</strong> and business that have a high intellectual property content are critical to restoring broad-based economic growth and job creation, yet they are widely pirated, stolen and copied.</blockquote>
Forget for one moment that this is part of their proposed "alternative foreign policy" to the Republicans' elitist, corporatist agenda.  They're trying to protect <em>farmers</em>.  Please, Pelosi, show me some fucking farmers that make a living off intellectual property of any sort.  If anything, <a href="http://www.sojo.net/index.cfm?action=magazine.article&issue=soj0504&article=050442a">they're suffering because of it</a>.  And for God sakes, check out <a href="http://www.percyschmeiser.com/">Percy Schmeiser</a> if you still have any doubts about whether the little guy belongs voting for the Democratic Party as it now stands.
