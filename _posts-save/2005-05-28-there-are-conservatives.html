<p>...like my friends at <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.typepad.com">Right Thinking Girl</a> who advocate positions with which I disagree, but they are at least rational and honest.  We get into some back and forth and it sometimes gets a little immature, but we respect the positions of one another and more than that we respect intelligence.</p><p>Then there are conservatives like <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jays2629/111716954193313676/">this</a>, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jays2629/111585989149208668/">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/jays2629/111586337172917248/">this</a>.  And it takes every mature bone in my body to not mentally project their stupidity onto my opinion of all conservatives.  I just can believe that there are people who are this dumb out there.  That's why we have the internet, I suppose.</p>
