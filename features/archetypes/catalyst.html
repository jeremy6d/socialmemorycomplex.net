<ul>
	<li>General introduction to Catalyst of experience
<ul>
	<li>Potential in the matrix has been potentiated and released into the things that can promote experience</li>
	<li>Presents the tapestry of the colors for to notice</li>
	<li>Based upon bias introduced by the potentiator</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><u>Catalyst of the Mind</u>
<ul>
	<li>Sun represents light of creator, shining through catalyst</li>
	<li>box represents third density illusion
<ul>
	<li>Box is full of eyes, indicating the multiplicity of potential viewpoint from which an entity can view catalyst</li>
	<li>These viewpoints have not yet been experienced, but exist in potential - experience has not occured</li>
	<li>box is murky, indicating the thoroughly mixed nature of catalyst from a polarized view</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Empress figure
<ul>
	<li>crown symbolizes nobility of the figure, and the extravagant opportunities catalyst provides the entity</li>
	<li>Symbology of arms = <strong>catalyst receives spirit from magnetic side (left) and transmutes it to magical opportunites (right)</strong></li>
	<li>Bird = spirit
<ul>
	<li>right wing pointing towards figure = spirit indicating positive nature of spiritual influence on catalyst - to expand beyond material illusion</li>
	<li>left wing pointing down = spirit indicating fixation of negative path on illusion</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Sitting on box = catalyst of the mind depends upon third density illusion and the potential for multiple viewpoints thereof</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><u>Catalyst of the Body</u>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Represents the nature of bodily catalyst as dependent on cyclical processes</strong></li>
	<li>Rotational energy patterns may be represented
<ul>
	<li>In both magnetics and torsion field research (see Wilcock) there is significance to direction of spin in regards to energy flow</li>
	<li>Right hand spin = radiative</li>
	<li>Left hand sping = magnetic</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Bias indicated in nature of bodily catalyst</li>
	<li>Which is significant figure: wheel (cyclical) or sphinx (linear)?</li>
	<li>Wheel
<ul>
	<li>Represents the cyclical nature of bodily catalyst</li>
	<li>Body processes occur continuously and repetitively</li>
	<li>Seven spokes and serpents
<ul>
	<li>indicative of wisdom at each chakra/density?</li>
	<li>four facing clockwise, four facing counterclockwise = bias towards radiative energetic pattern (see Wilcock)</li>
	<li>wisdom is catalytically available at any level of bodily vehicle</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Devils climbing on wheel = positive and negative nature of catalyst (generative or deliterious effects on body)
<ul>
	<li>They appear to be climbing in a counterclockwise direction
<ul>
	<li>left hand spin = magnetic energetically</li>
	<li>indicates that catalyst will result from a energetically magnetic configuration = limited life span / bodily decay?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>flames/serpents from both heads = opportunities for wisdom of use</li>
	<li>devil on right = positive catalyst of body
<ul>
	<li>facing up = proper configuration of body</li>
	<li>no tail = ?</li>
	<li>feline head = protective nature</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>devil on left = negative catalyst of body
<ul>
	<li>facing down = improper configuration of body</li>
	<li>crocodile head = fearsome nature / destructive</li>
	<li>ram horns = beastial nature amplified</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Sphinx = protection?  threat?  merely pointing?
<ul>
	<li>falcon on back = influence of spirit</li>
	<li>holding downward pointing spear in right hand, pointing at right hand devil
<ul>
	<li>does this indicate the finite span of time life has?</li>
	<li>does this indicate right hand devil has protection or vulnerability?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Winged disk at base of wheel pole = ?
<ul>
	<li>Ra?</li>
	<li>root chakra (center of power for body, drawn magnetically up)</li>
	<li>representation of chakras indicated by position of winged disk and wheel?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li><u>Catalyst of the Spirit</u>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nuturing</strong> aspect?</li>
	<li><strong>Represents two ways to use spirit</strong> (water)</li>
	<li>Star
<ul>
	<li>Diamond in middle
<ul>
	<li>positive = upwards, negative = downwards</li>
	<li>resembles octahedral shape = 3rd density indicator?</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Outer 8 pointed star = octave? represents nature of creator?</li>
	<li>plant is growing in light</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Female figure
<ul>
	<li>Naked = exposed, unveiled subconscious or receptive quality?</li>
	<li>pouring water from right and left hands
<ul>
	<li>water symbolizes spirit(?)</li>
	<li>left hand pouring into a body of water
<ul>
	<li>indicates spiritual catalyst is wasted on left hand path since it's pouring water into water?</li>
	<li>it is not growing anything</li>
	<li>rests upon right knee</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>right hand pouring onto soil
<ul>
	<li>watering a plant</li>
	<li>nuturing quality to positive nature of spiritual catalyst</li>
	<li>held free, unsupported</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Kneeling = indicative of passive nature?
<ul>
	<li>Right knee down = greater passivity in positive nature?  willingness to stay and tend plant</li>
	<li>Left knee up = greater activity in negative nature?  Not willing to stay and tend</li>
	<li>left hand water vessel resting on right knee = relationship between STS and STO dominant/passive or dependency?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Plant = fertile nature of positive spiritual catalyst
<ul>
	<li>two flowered plant wrapped around bigger plant
<ul>
	<li>indicates duality?</li>
	<li>rightward facing flower above leftward = bias?</li>
	<li>twining around bigger plant starts at level of pitcher</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>three flowered plant = trinity?
<ul>
	<li>number three is represented throughout spirit archetypes</li>
	<li>growing in light of Creator</li>
	<li>butterfly alighting
<ul>
	<li>spirit will alight upon positive nature of spiritual catalyst?</li>
	<li>significance of different representation of winged spirit?</li>
	<li>spirit resting / getting sustenance?</li>
</ul>
