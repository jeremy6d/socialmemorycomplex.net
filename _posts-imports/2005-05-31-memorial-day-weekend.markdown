<p>Friday: <a href="http://alisonkrauss.com/">Alison Krauss and Union Station</a>.  Alison is the biggest geek in the world - especially for a bluegrass singer.  Corny jokes + greatest female voice I've ever heard live = good show.  Just wish they hadn't packed us like sardines on the floor.</p><p>Saturday: going away cookout at Nicole's parents' house for John and Nicole, as they left Sunday to move to Fort Lewis.</p><p>Sunday: Party at our friend Lauren's place, which was fun and netted us a first stab at getting a decent engagement picture (which <a href="http://www.mattwalters.net">Matt</a> documented <a href="http://blog.mattwalters.net/archives/106">here</a>).</p><p>Monday: Tasha worked, I stayed home and chilled at a cookout with my neighbors.  Had a blast.  Matt came over and visited, too, and showed me a photo album he's putting together.</p><p>All in all, pretty decent Memorial Day weekend.</p>
