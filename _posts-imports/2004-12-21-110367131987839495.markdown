How's your Xmas season going?  That's right, I took the "Christ" out of "Christmas".  What.

Anyway, I just got over a nasty cold, put new tires on my lil' Jetta, and got a buncha work done on some music projects I've been working on.  Here are two little snippets of my latest tracks: <a href="http://www.6thdensity.net/music/demos/It's%20All%20Experiences.mp3">It's All Experiences</a> and <a href="http://www.6thdensity.net/music/demos/Spirit%20Bling.mp3">Spirit Bling</a>.  There's more of this at the <a href="http://6thdensity.net">6th Density Research and Recording web site</a>.

And let me just say that Brothers Past's new EP <a href="http://bp.thropter.com/merch.asp">State Police</a> makes a great stocking stuffer.
