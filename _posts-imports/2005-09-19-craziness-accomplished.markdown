<p>Well, it's over.  The wedding was <b>great</b>.  A little hot, but awesome.  Pictures are going up right now - we got the first digitals the day after from a friend of Tasha's family (UPDATE: first pictures are posted <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jeremy6d/44705438/in/set-977245/">here</a>).</p><p>Apparently, many people commented that it was the nicest wedding they had ever attended.  Considering the amount of effort, design, and expense Tasha put into it, that is awfully gratifying.  Thanks for all your support, everybody!</p><p>Right now we're at Matt's mom's beach house in Nags Head, NC, trying to relax.  We've got WiFi access so I'll try and keep you updated on our honeymoon.  And Matt and Matt's brother are both accomplished photographers, so just expect more pics.</p>
