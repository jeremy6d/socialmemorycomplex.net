Hey, y'all, thanks for checking out my outpost on the web.  Let the indoctrination begin...

I'm still not sure why I'm embarking on blogging.  All in all, it just seems like a way for malcontents to rant and rave.  It seems to do more sometimes to marginalize discussion on the internet than to promote it, and from some of the conversations I've been in over the net, I can understand why that would be desirable.  I'd like to believe that dialogue on the internet can lead to creative and thoughtful discourse (even humor like <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wilforbis/weblogs/blogger.htm">my bud Wil's blog</a>) but experience has shown that the internet tends to draw out the worst in people (such as <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wilforbis/weblogs/blogger.htm">my bud Wil's blog</a> - HAHAHAHA).

However, holding with my idea that the internet represents a major step forward in the conversion of humanity to a more integrated, interdependent sense of identity - indeed, a Social Memory Complex (more on that later, in the meantime, check out my <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/socialmemorycomplex/">original music under the same name</a> - I want to at least put my views out there and let the chips fall where they may.  I think recent events are catalyzing change at both an individual and collective level, whether or not people realize it.  My bet is that there is value to be gained by talking about this.  We shall see.

And for anybody who's finding this from Wil's blog, calling somebody gay is hereby verboten.  If you're gonna insult people, use your fucking imagination.  

Now let's see what happens in the comment list, now that I've released their inner creativity... express the child within
