The universe is wierd.  I get turned down for one job (programming slot machines) but I get a raise and promotion at my current job.  Huh.

Anyway, just checking in... I submitted my three original drum and bass tracks to the Brothers Past Fan Sampler project, so hopefully you'll be able to get a copy soon.

Might go camping this weekend, might not.  Whatever.
