How do I provide such mind blowing content? (I see the look of utter disbelief on your face.  Through the screen.)  Well, I use cool websites to get information, ideas, etc.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://del.icio.us">Del.icio.us</a>: great way to bookmark sites and carry those bookmarks around with you no matter what computer you're at.  There's <a href="http://del.icio.us/help/firefox/extension">an extension for Firefox</a> that allows you to easily tag, or apply a one word label to, any page you visit.  So if I read a page that's about politics that I want to save, I simply tag it with the label "politics".  Now, anytime I go back to del.icio.us, I can see <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d/politics">all my pages with the "politics" tag</a>.  Not only that: you can share tags and pages with others in the del.icio.us community.  As the community grows, all these people tagging things is starting to form a sort of web that is contextualizing the web spontaneously!
There's other cool things you can do, too:  Matt told me about using a special tag with which you label pages you want to follow up on.  So anytime I visit a page I want to return to in order to read more in depth, I tag it with "toread".  I have a live bookmark in my toolbar that is served by an RSS feed from del.icio.us of all my "toread" items.  Whenever I want to read something, I always have a queue of interesting items to go to!  And as soon as I'm done reading it, I simply remove the "toread" tag (I'd like to come up with a one click way to do this).</li>
	<li><a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a>:  I've been into flickr for some time, but it has a slick user interface and great features.  You can blog with it, catalog and tag pictures, share with friends, etc.  Just a great place to have pictures overall - worth the money, I assure you.</li>
	<li><a href="http://oyogi.com">Oyogi</a>: A great resource for asking questions.  There are powerful search features that allow you to leverage the knowledge of the internet community, rather than just the documents it's generated.  Lots of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">ajax</a>y stuff along with a great Javascript chat client.</li>
	<li><a href="http://runbox.com">Runbox</a>: I keep track of 10 different email accounts here.  Their UI could use some work but overall it's a pretty nice system.  10 gigs of email storage should keep me busy.</li>
	<li><a href="http://drudgereport.com">Drudge Report</a>: I know, I know... but it's a great way to keep up with the mainstream.  If you're into that thing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://feedlounge.com">FeedLounge</a>: Since <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt</a> has ended his OneFeed service, I tried out some free feed reading systems but they just didn't cut it.  The UI for FeedLounge is acceptably slick (again, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29">ajax</a>) and I love the tagging!  Alex King also is letting the users vote on new features.  Seems very tidy for such a new service.  All we need now is a merging of FeedLounge tags with Del.icio.us tags.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Just so people's feelings don't get hurt, this post is not about blogs - it was more about impersonal services I use.</p>
