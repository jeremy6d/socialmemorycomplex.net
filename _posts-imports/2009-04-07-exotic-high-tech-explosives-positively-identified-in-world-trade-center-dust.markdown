title: Exotic High Tech Explosives Positively Identified in World Trade Center Dust
excerpt: "&quot;A ground-breaking scientific paper confirmed this week that red-gray flakes found throughout multiple samples of WTC dust are actually unexploded fragments of nanothermite, an exotic high-tech explosive.  The samples were taken from far-separated locations in Manhattan, some as early as 10 minutes after the second tower (WTC 1) collapsed, ruling out any possible contamination from cleanup operations.  Authored by an international team of physicists, chemists, and others, the research paper was titled \x93Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe.\x94 It was published in The Open Chemical Physics Journal, 2009, Vol. 2., and is available online for free download. The lead author is Niels H. Harrit of the Department of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen.&quot;"
