<p>Being a recent air passenger, I found <a href="http://jcmartinblog.blogspot.com/2005/04/tales-from-sky-1.html">this flight attendant's story</a> pretty entertaining for some reason.  Probably because it kind of reminded me of long bus trips in high school.  Great example of why I'm glad I'm not in the customer service industry...</p>
