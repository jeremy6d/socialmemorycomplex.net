My boy <a href="http://blog.mattwalters.net/">Sizzle</a> has an <a href="http://blog.mattwalters.net/archives/29">interesting "rant"</a> that he posted some days ago about some cockamimey Bloggers Bill of Rights:<blockquote>What I fail to see though is how bloggers see this as any different from commenting on an article in the newspaper, etc. If you divulge trade secrets of your company or divulge confidential information, why shouldn't your company be able to sue/fire you? Employees need to use supreme discretion in talking about the companies they work for. For instance I will most likely never mention anything about my new job other then the fact I got the job. Why? Because I don't want to risk my job.</blockquote>To which I replied:<blockquote>Stop joshing everybody, Matt.  You know you ain't got no job.</blockquote>Sorry guys... he gets back from the welfare office and gets a few drinks in him... and suddenly he thinks he's Mr. Philosophical.
