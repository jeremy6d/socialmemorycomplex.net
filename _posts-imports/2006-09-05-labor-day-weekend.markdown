<p>This weekend was pretty lazy for me.  It's kind of sad: Tasha spent most of it in front of her computer, and I in front of mine.  Luckily, I do have something to show for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>I made a lot of progress on a new, custom theme for my blog, but I still have a lot of work to do.  The cool thing is that I think I'm "getting" CSS finally, as this theme has no trace of an HTML table anywhere in it.  It will also make <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?page_id=397">my linkblog</a> more prominent and generally make the front page of the blog much more relevant and immediate.  I'm aiming for a design that says "6th density", and that rules out just about every WordPress theme in existence.</li>
<li>For quite some time I've been asking for a Firefox extension to queue up my del.icio.us items tagged with "toread".  This weekend, I've come this close to finishing a preliminary version.  I've got a sidebar with a list of items, and clicking on them will open them in the browser window.  But in order to streamline to workflow I'd like opening a "toread" item in the browser window to automatically remove the "toread" tag from the post in del.icio.us, and doing this asynchronously is a little tricky.  But I'm almost there - contact me if you'd like to try it out when I release it.  I've established a page for the project <a href="http://blog.6thdensity.net/?page_id=504">here</a>.</li>
<li>Hung out with <a href="http://mattwalters.net">Matt</a> and some other friends this weekend.</li>
<li>Watched season 4 of 24 again.  It's great background noise for doing web design (you spend 90% of your time reloading pages anyway).</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm sort of in a lull on ThreadSpinner right now as I rethink the project in terms of some new ideas I've been having.
</p>
