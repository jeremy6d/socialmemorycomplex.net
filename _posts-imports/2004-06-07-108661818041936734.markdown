[Greg Palast](http://www.gregpalast.com/detail.cfm?artid=336&amp;row=0) once again makes a good point that, all in all, Reagan sucked.  If he were held to account for the bullshit that happened during his presidency, I think his death and funeral would be at least as low key as Nixon's.  I take back what I said before about him being anything better than a thug.
