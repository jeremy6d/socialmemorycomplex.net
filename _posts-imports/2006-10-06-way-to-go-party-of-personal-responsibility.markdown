Let's backtrack for one second, you rowdy right wing bloggers, you.

A congressman is caught red-handed engaging in explicit conversations with minors.  The highest echelons of Republican leadership are implicated in a cover-up.

And the best you can come up with is that the Democrats are <a href="http://www.macsmind.com/wordpress/2006/09/30/foley-setup/">just as bad</a> or <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200610020013">worse</a>?

<a href="http://sheldonfreeassociation.blogspot.com/">Sheldon Richman</a> points out another <a href="http://sheldonfreeassociation.blogspot.com/2006/10/foley-hits-trifecta.html">gem of personal responsibility</a>:
<blockquote>It's official now: U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, who quit Congress after getting caught sending sexually explicit messages to teenaged male congressional pages, is an <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/10/03/foley.scandal/index.html"><span style="font-weight: bold">alcoholic, mentally ill, and a victim of sexual abuse by a clergyman</span></a>. In other words, he's hit the psychiatric trifecta. He's now in rehab. But he's not offering any of this as an excuse for his inappropriate conduct. He just thought we'd like to know.</blockquote>
