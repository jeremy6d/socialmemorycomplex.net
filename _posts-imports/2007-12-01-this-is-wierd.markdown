<p>I'm not sure what this TV Funhouse segment on Saturday Night Live proves: that NBC magnanimously allows writing staff a wide range of opinion, or NBC and GE are so established that they don't even have to worry about public opinion.  Somehow I think it's the latter, coupled with a presentation of these issues that doesn't reflect their gravity (hence, the humor) nor gives the viewer enough time to really learn about them.</p><p align=center><object width="425" height="355"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/WHXBUJAL03o&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/WHXBUJAL03o&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" width="425" height="355"></embed></object></p><p>Hat tip to <a href="http://agonist.org/bolo/20071201/saturday_tv_funhouse_subversion">the Agonist</a>.</p>
