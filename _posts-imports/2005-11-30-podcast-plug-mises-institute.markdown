<p>I've been enjoying the <a href="http://www.mises.org/">Mises Institute</a> <a href="http://www.mises.org/rss.aspx">podcasts</a>, in particular one by Hans-Hermann Hoppe titled <a href="http://www.mises.org/multimedia/mp3/ss05/ss05-Hoppe.mp3">The Economic Doctrine of the Nazis</a>.  Very interesting comparison of Hitler's philosophy towards economics and his opinions of his contemporaries.</p><p>Also, a great show is the <a href="http://weekendinterviewshow.com/">Weekend Interview Show with Scott Horton</a>.  Laid back interviews, lots of humor, and always antiwar and antistate.</p>
