I read [Counterpunch](http://www.counterpunch.org) selectively - it's pretty left leaning - but when you have politics like mine, you take a little from column A and a little from column B.  Over the years, I've learned to find points of agreement with conversants rather than seek out the points of disagreement (that is, unless I think we can handle a fistfight at that particular point in our friendship).

<strong>Anyway</strong> <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/madsen06042004.html">This article</a> talks about a possible military coup if the neoconservatives try any funny business this election year.  Also, there's this little disturbing blurb:

<blockquote>If the military does have to purge the Executive Branch of nut cases and les démagogues très dangereux, they will find support from Gore, who somehow wound up on a "check baggage" alert list at Reagan National Airport when he was boarding a flight to Wisconsin. Candidates for the Green Party and the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate have been similarly placed on passenger watch lists in what has become a Soviet-style system of internal travel controls and checkpoints.</blockquote>

What the fuck?  People would be up in arms if they knew this shit was going on... I mean, first of all, how can the Libertarian candidate even afford airfare?

Heh heh, just kidding... and hey, whaddaya know, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/vest05292004.html">they agree with me about Kerry</a>!

<blockquote>Kerry's election is by no means a foregone conclusion. Should he win, however, the joys of beating Bush, however intensely felt, could be short-lived. For one thing, whoever takes the oath in January 2005, all signs indicate that the draft is on its way back, meaning that many of the best and brightest, who would have otherwise made "great" sacrifices, will be heading for Canada again.</blockquote>

<strong>EXACTLY</strong>.  You <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments.php?user=greenlantern113&amp;comment=108612686288750100#1705">Kerry sluts</a> read up now.
