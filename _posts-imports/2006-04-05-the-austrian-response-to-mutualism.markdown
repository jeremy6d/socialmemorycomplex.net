<img style="float:right; margin:3px;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6278/764/320/jls.jpg"><p><a href="http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/04/nunc-dimittis-or-carson-hits-big-time.html">According to Kevin</a>, the current issue of the <a href="http://www.mises.org/jlsdisplay.asp">Journal of Libertarian Studies</a> concentrates on critiques of mutualism and Carson's rebuttal.  I'm anxiously awaiting the print copy of the Journal, but Kevin <a href="http://mutualist.blogspot.com/2006/04/nunc-dimittis-or-carson-hits-big-time.html">links</a> to pdfs of the current issue's articles.  However, I wanted to make sure the <a href="http://mises.org">Mises Institute</a> knew of the interest in <a href="http://mutualist.org">mutualism</a>, so I went ahead and not only subscribed but also sent an email explicitly stating why.  I encourage you to investigate the debate between two of the most authentically libertarian schools of thought.  <b>My heartfelt congratulations to Kevin on both his book and the well-deserved attention his work is receiving!</b></p>
