<p>A great figure in the libertarian cause has passed on.  Read more about it <a href="http://www.downsizedc.org/blog/2006/mar/02/harry_browne_r_i_p">here</a>.  I was fortunate enough to see Harry speak once during the 2000 election.  His passion for liberty moved me to work for the cause of freedom.  I even had a chance to speak with him about my concerns with corporatism, and he was gracious and open with me (while disagreeing).  I'm deeply saddened by this, but Harry had been sick for some time and he can now rest in peace.  God bless you, Harry Browne.  My condolences and prayers to his family.</p><p>UPDATE: <a href="http://knappster.blogspot.com/2006/03/harry-browne-1933-2006.html">Thomas Knapp has a much better tribute to Harry</a>.  So does <a href="http://blog.mises.org/archives/004752.asp">Lew Rockwell</a>.</p>
