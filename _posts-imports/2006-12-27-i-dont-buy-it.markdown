When I first heard of Barr cozying up to the <a href="http://www.lp.org">Libertarian Party</a>, I thought I was trapped in the twilight zone.  According to <a href="http://reason.com">Reason</a>'s <a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/">Hit and Run blog</a>, though, Bob Barr - former drug zealot in Congress - <a href="http://www.reason.com/blog/show/117470.html">has come around</a> on the drug war.  There's talk of him assuming a leadership position within the party apparatus.  Even Ron Kampia of the <a href="http://www.mpp.org/">Marijuana Policy Project</a> has come out in favor of him, and those guys <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle-old/179/theinquisition.shtml">went at it pretty hard</a> when Barr was in office.  So now he's talking about states rights on drug laws and research into medical marijuana only years after having fought those proposals tooth and nail.  He also acknowledges that the War on Drugs is a failure.

I don't have any problem with people reassessing their beliefs and principles, reflecting on their actions, and having a change of heart.  But the LP <a href="http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/249/lpads.shtml">orchestrated a campaign</a> during his final election to get him thrown from office.  I find it hard to believe that a politician (an incurable condition if there ever was one) is willing not only to forgive that but to convert to their positions.  If the LP has any sense whatsoever, they will throw Bob out on his ass.
