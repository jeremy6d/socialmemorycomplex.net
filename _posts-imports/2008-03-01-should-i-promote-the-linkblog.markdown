title: Should I promote the linkblog?

<p>I hope all my readers, to the extent they enjoy reading my posts, also check out the linkblog on the sidebar (or on <a href="http://del.icio.us/jeremy6d/linkblog">its homepage</a>).  There is so much information on the net, but I can't write about all of it.  Linkblogging gives me a way to share information with you without necessarily adding my two cents - since I don't always have something to add.</p><p>However, I'm seriously considering taking the linkblog out of "special" status on the sidebar and figuring out a way to incorporate it directly into the flow of posts in the blog.  I'd be interested in your thoughts, on this blog and in general:<ol><li>Do you pay attention to the linkblog?</li><li>What's your opinion of the linkblog?  Is it more or less interesting than the regular posts?</li><li>How would you feel about links going into the regular blog flow?</li></ol>The issue is not just blog administration; I'm actually considering writing my own blog software that integrates better with social bookmarking services.</p>
