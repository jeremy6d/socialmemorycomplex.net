<p>McCain <a href="http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/president/conventions/videos/transcripts/20080904_MCCAIN_SPEECH.html">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>My friends, if you find faults with our country, make it a better one. If you're disappointed with the mistakes of government, join its ranks and work to correct them.</p></blockquote><p>Just <a href="http://www.dailynewscaster.com/2008/09/04/secret-service-confiscates-books-button-from-ron-paul-delegates/">don't join it's ranks from within the Republican party</a>:<blockquote><p>Today at the Republican National Convention, as the Ron Paul Delegates were taking a picture in front of the model White House inside the Convention Center, they were surrounded by Secret Service which proceeded to search the bags of all the delegates. They took any and everything related to Ron Paul including signs, buttons, videos, slim jims, cards, even books.</p></blockquote><p>They were <a href="http://www.ronpaulwarroom.com/?p=13280">followed, surveilled, and harassed</a>.  Indeed, even if you make it into the ranks of government, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/02/paul.convention/">they may still try to hold you back</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Earlier Tuesday, Paul said he was told he could go to the Republican convention floor, but only under very restricted conditions.</p><p>The Republican National Committee told Paul he would have to pick up his pass at the gate and couldn't have any guests.</p><p>"Republican congressmen should have a pass to the floor, but they said, 'Your pass will be at the gate, and we'll pick it up when you leave, and you can't take anybody with you,' " he said on CNN's "American Morning."</p></blockquote><p>And since <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rnc-protesters.html">they're treating even peaceful protest and civil disobedience as terrorism</a>, they're leaving us with very few options.  Whether we see our role in fixing problems as within, without, or against government, the response is clear: submit or suffer.  Make this a better country, but a better country according to <em>our</em> definition, not yours.  And don't make any sudden moves while you're working on those flaws!</p>
