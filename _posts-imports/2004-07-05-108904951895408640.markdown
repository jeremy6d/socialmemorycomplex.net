Happy Independence Day.  <a href="http://www.razormouth.com/-/000033.html">This article</a> pretty much describes how I feel about it.

But it wasn't what I was thinking about yesterday.  Yesterday I was on Interstate 95 coming back from a <a href="http://www.brotherspast.com">Brothers Past </a>show and after party that lasted till 8 AM trying to deal with a hangover without becoming an interpersonal Cro-magnon man.  Ugh, yesterday was nasty.  I hate Maryland House.  But the BP <a href="http://www.bpradio.net/cgi-bin/yabb/YaBB.cgi?board=bp;action=display;num=1088931705">show</a> was totally worth it!  I even met a fellow BP fan who is a more active Libertarian (upper case L intended) than I!  A good time was had by all.  Until I took that last shot of whatever the hell that was.
