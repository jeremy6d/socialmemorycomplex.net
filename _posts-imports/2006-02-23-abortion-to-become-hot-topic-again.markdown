<p>As if the past twenty years have not been enough, we're about to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060223/pl_nm/rights_abortion_dc">decide in a court of law</a> what should be decided <a href="http://www.moonbatty.com/blog/2006/01/31/like-hell-its-not-about-abortion/#comment-6868">by societal consensus</a>.  Gee, I can't wait for a bunch of hotheads to clash once more and monopolize the news with their tortured arguments about how life as we know it will cease to exist unless we do what their God says / do what their body wants.  I believe in a woman's right to choose, but not strongly enough to listen to her bitch about incessantly - let alone a whole nation of N.O.W. activists.  And holy shit we are going to see some bible thumping the likes of which haven't been seen Jimmy Swaggart accidentally copulated on top of one in the backseat of his limo.</p><p>I just want to go off into the woods, grow a beard, and eat trail mix for the rest of my life.  And write code.  This may be the event that forces my hand.</p>
