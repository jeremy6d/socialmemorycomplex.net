I'll give you a topic: the blog's new look, discuss.

Oh yeah, check out this essay a wrote for my friend <a href="http://www.thehelixnetwork.com/Eskm-bio.htm">Eskmo</a> and his website <a href="http://www.thehelixnetwork.com/index2.htm">The Helix Network</a> called <a href="http://thehelixnetwork.com/history_as_the_ev.html"><em>History as the Evolution of Identity</em></a>.  

Why did I write this article?  Because the idea of the <a href="http://www.soundclick.com/bands/5/socialmemorycomplex.htm">social memory complex</a> is the type of collective I think our planet is headed towards throughout history and currently.  It's been coming for some time; the question is simply whether it will be positive or negative.  We must come together to solve the problems we face, but we have to do it in via each and every individual.  We can't form this complex, and thus tap into the power of the collective, without each and every individual taking his or her irreplacable spot in the collective.

Let me know what you think.  Well, not you, but the rest of you.
