Whoa, another week or two's gone by.  Time to blog in a cynical, meaningless manner.

The past week was crazy, what with Sabine visiting and our trip to Louisville.  It was good to see everybody.  We flew back and have basically been trying to do stuff without having me take a lot of time off work.  Saturday we went to D.C. and hung out in Fredericksburg seeing a band Matt is friends with.  Also hung out with my good friend Bill.  Sunday we went to the A.R.E., the beach, the Bier Garden (favorite restaurant ever), and hung out with Chris.  So I'm pretty wiped out.

We're gonna try to go hiking in Shenendoah sometime this week, but weather's looking shitty.  Also, Friday we're going to Philadelphia to see Brothers Past and all the other sites in Philly.

Sabine is really nice and I'm glad she's visiting.  She's a little too nice, as she doesn't tell me when she needs something or wants to do something I haven't anticipated.  But we're having a good time, and she's getting along well with Tasha.  Now I have somebody to visit in Europe!  Sweet.
