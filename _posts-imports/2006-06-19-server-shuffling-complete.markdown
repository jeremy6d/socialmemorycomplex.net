<p><strong>NOTE: If you tried to email me within the past day or two, your email probably got lost during the switch.  Please resend, as my 6thdensity.net account is working once more.  Thank you.</strong></p><p>The Social Memory Complex blog has been moved to <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a>.  Thanks, <a href="http://blog.jimvanfleet.com">Jim</a>, for suggesting them - they look like the perfect solution for me.</p><p>I'm going to have a lot of stuff to write about very soon, but right now I need to make sure my other domains are purring along, then we'll be set!  Also, I'm in the middle of moving to a new house so bear with me.</p><p>Feel free to post comments again!</p>
