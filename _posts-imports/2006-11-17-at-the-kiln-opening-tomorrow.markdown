This weekend I'll be at in Mathews to attend the <a href="http://potterybytasha.blogspot.com/2006/11/kiln-openings-in-mathews-county.html">annual kiln opening</a> at the Poddery, the studio where my wife works.Â  I usually just drink beer and direct cars, but if you like ceramics you should definitely check it out.
