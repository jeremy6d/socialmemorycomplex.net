<p>Thanks for your patience, ladies and gents.  After moving my sites to a new host and moving my ass to a new house, I'm finally settled enough to start addressing you supposedly "real" people out there on the 'net.  Social Memory Complex should be returning to its regular schedule of ranting, meandering, and potlickin' good political economic social cultural analysis.  Or at least what passes for it here.</p><p>In other news: <ul><li>I'm beginning to set my studio back up and start recording the asskicking, 6th density electronica you all have come to <s>expect</s> forget about.</li><li>Some compadres of mine whose company I share commenting on <a href="http://rightthinkinggirl.com">Right Thinking Girl</a> have established <a href="http://wrongthinkinggirl.com">a blog</a> on which to vent.  Check it out!</li></ul></p>
