<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/16/vtech.shooting/index.html">Here's the story</a>. Just talked to my brother, who is finishing up his engineering PhD in one of the buildings where people were indiscriminately shot.  He's fine, thank God, and is now adamant about acquiring a concealed carry license.

I, for one, am buying a gun extremely soon. I'm not saying it's everybody's responsibility to carry firearms.  But I just feel like if the madmen are going to learn how to operate these devices, I probably should.  And for Christ's sake, I do <strong>not</strong> want to wait for the cops to show up if my life is in danger.
