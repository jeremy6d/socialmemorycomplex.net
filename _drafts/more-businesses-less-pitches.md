title: More businesses, less pitches
subtitle: A critique of Startup Weekend
---

I got my start in software development at a startup.  In college I had a great internship at a company called NetTalon writing Windows UIs for an internet-friendly remote security systems (in 2000 this was a groundbreaking idea).  I went a few pay periods without a check, but I also got an enormous amount of autonomy.  There was a lot of emotions involved despite me not having an equity stake in it.  Sometimes I wonder if my career since then has been learning the lessons I need to learn to get back to that raw, getting shit done feeling I had back then.

So a 54 hour even 

I'm no business expert

- too much focus on the competition.  Why even have judges?  If you're going to have judges, the criteria should be something more than the judge being too unimaginative to accept your idea.  The truly disruptive ideas should be rejected by the kinds of conservative judges RVASW had.  That's too bad, since I'm skeptical of any idea they'd invest in.
- too much focus on pitching.  Setting aside the inherent necessity for presenting something to the judges in order to make a competition possible, when do you actually need to pitch in a real startup situation?  When you're raising money, which is precisely what no 54 hour old team needs to be thinking about.  It's great if you have a good pitch for your business, but it's not great to make that the end-all-be-all of the work you do that is at the very core of your business
- too many interruptions. Because SW is an event before it is a place to found a business, you always get a nagging sense your startup as a business, as a thing you care about, is not really the priority for the organizers.  Frankly, it shouldn't be--running the event should be their focus.  But when they interrupt you to do cheers, play games, and fit your experience into the mold that works best for them, it is incredibly frustrating. You're asking people to work on an awesome idea they care about--but stop working on it right now!  Inspiration doesn't operate on a day camp schedule, and it would be fine if the organizers weren't so insistent on you attending every little pow-wow that Startup Weekend HQ says you're supposed to attend.  Unfortunately, they often do.
- too little reflection on the concept of startups. It's a little weird that the entire mentality behind startups is supposed to be disruptive, outside-the-box, doing something nobody's thought of, and yet we're supposed to adhere to this format that sometimes feels more like a reality show than a serious creative endeavor. 

Why are startups so important that the Kauffman Foundation is involved
