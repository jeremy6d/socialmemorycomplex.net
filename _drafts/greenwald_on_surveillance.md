Glenn Greenwald's talk on the surveillance state is absolutely crucial viewing.  He makes a variety of arguments about why the sweeping power to monitor all citizens is deeply corrupting to civil society.  Especially for a people who claim to be free, the pernicious thing about total surveillance is the degree to which it curtails one's sense of autonomy and freedom.  For me the most chilling argument is the one where he explains how a culture of constant surveillance creates stunted human beings:

    There are studies in what was formerly East Germany, which was probably one of the most notorious surveillance states in the last 50 years, where even once their boundaries were removed, once the Stazi no longer existed, once the wall fell... the psychological effects on East German people endure until today. The way in which they have been trained for decades to understand that there are limits to their life, even once you remove the limits, they’ve been trained that those are not things they need to transgress.

    And that’s one of the things that constantly surveilling people and constantly communicating to them that they’re powerless against this omnipotent government corporate institution does to people, it convinces people that the tiny little box in which they live is really the only box in which they want to live so they don’t even realize being in prison.

    Rosa Luxembourg said, “He who does not move does not notice his chains.”

    You can acculturate people to believing that tyranny is freedom, that their limits are actually emancipations and freedom, that is what this Surveillance State does, by training people  to accept their own conformity that they are actually free, that they no longer even realize the ways in which they’re being limited.

As Greenwald points out, anytime somebody knows they are "on the record", they immediately change how they speak to be much more careful.  Imagine this is as a constant state.  Government already has immense internal secrecy and wide ranging police powers.  How can somebody challenge their government as an activist if, in addition to all that, the government has exponentially more of a

A huge reason to oppose a government of society is that individuals are constructed by society.  The indivdual is defined by his environment
