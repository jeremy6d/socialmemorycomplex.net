need to understand the co-dependent nature of the quest for freedom

the framing of improving our condition as a struggle against some enemy makes our identity dependent on that enemy

Before we can decide to waht end we should direct our will, we must figure out how to know what we want.  This is actually a very tricky question

Who are we if not conditioned entities reacting to society's molding

Do we every truly get beyond that?

Is social reproduction an enemy against which individuals are arrayed in revolt, or is it that there is no such thing as individualism and collectivism as completely exclusive categories

Most individualists appeal to institutions like the market in order to define reduce agency to the ritual of transaction and the self-interest of material gratification

This is a sadly narrow concept of the self, one that many would hardly find worth fighting for at all

Is egoism and the abolition of spooks truly possible without a deeper examination of our awareness?  Is not our ability to attune our awareness the ultimate freedom?

Egoism has a tendency to exalt the capitalist-constructed individual and call that value system "nihilism" when it has nothing to do with what that should mean: the expulsion of the spook
