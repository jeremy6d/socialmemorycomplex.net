* How it came together

I first heard about Occupy Wall Street while travelling in Europe with Tasha. It got started on September 17, 2011 -- the day we celebrated our sixth anniversary at a French restaurant in Berlin. As we continued our two week tour, I saw a surprising amount of coverage for something that looked like the latest lifestyle anarchist stunt. And since I was reading David Graeber's Debt: The First 5,000 Years, I was following what was up with him and, of course, Occupy was what was up with him at the time. So by the time we got back to the states right before the beginning of October, it was a big deal.

Once we were settled back in at home (we had to get a tree off our house that had fallen, plus I had to marry my friends Matt and Carrie) I found out about a potluck meeting that several activists were holding. Some of my activist friends and I were suspicious of this group, whom we did not know. Already at that time there were rumblings of co-optation by liberals. I went ahead and bought the "occupyrva" domain so just in case we'd have a way to contest the direction of the movement. A mass meeting was announced for Thursday, October 6 in Monroe Park, and I went to that to see just what was up.
