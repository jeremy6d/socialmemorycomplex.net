title: Holding the Flame Close
subtitle: Albert J. Nock's radical alternative to political activism
---

- Read "Isaiah's Job" about "the remnant" (it's not the same because it must keep watch on consensus society)
- I doubt the ability of any person or group, movement or institution to effect discrete political ends directly
- political ends are not simply narrow changes of status in one vector, but shifts in mindset that create new realities
- we have always thought of engaging in politics as a direct, head on clash with the other side
- what if that's a bad way to go about it
- what if we accept that we aren't smart enough to engage in politics to directly achieve our ends
- what if we instead cultivate a movement that tries to keep the flame of our idealistic vision alive
- but at the same time we have to keep our finger on the pulse of politics and remain relevant
- the power of political activism is not to organize or strategize but to be able to choose the time and place
- true effectiveness comes from choosing when to strike, not how hard
- political movements must create countercultures that can keep a flame alive waiting for the right time to activate
- the beauty of this is that we don't necessarily take responsibility for side-effects, instead those are blamed on the surrounding conditions
- it's all about taking advantage of the dinosaur's lumbering, slow defense
- we are creating a counterculture not focused on political activism per se, more of a ritual culture maintaining a tradition that has not yet been realized
- focus on creating art and cultural artifacts that maintain inspiration, this might allow integration between present and ideal future
- Hakim Bey's tongs
- the status quo benefits from its status as a system whose institutions CAN bide their time and wait for opportunities

The history of modern ideological movements should make a poor impression on any young, eager idealist.  If the modus operandi of activism is sound, there's really no good reason we should be stuck in such a rigid and unremarkable political status quo.  Look at the raw material we have to work with: technology that concentrates and grows power beyond what any despot of antiquity could dream of, the massive wealth produced by globalized capitalism, the explosion of academic work to provide intellectual lenses with which to understand political possibilities, enormous populations with pretty good discipline and copious opportunities for manipulation, etc.It's all sitting there, available to any group sufficiently organized and determined to capture it.  Why have movements been unable to challenge the compartively lame and uninspiring duck represented by late stage liberal capitalism?
